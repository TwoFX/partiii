Let $A$ be a ring and let $S \subseteq A$ be a multiplicative subset (i.e., $1 \in S$ and
$S$ is closed under multiplication). We define a ring
\[ S^{-1}A = \set{(a, s)\given a \in A, s \in S}/\sim, \]
where $(a, s) \sim (a', s')$ iff there is $s'' \in S$ such that
$s''(as'-a's) = 0$.

We write $a/s$ for the equivalence class of $(a, s)$.

Observe that the usual equivalence relation on fractions suggests that we should
have $a/s = a'/s' \iff as' = a's$. We need the extra possibility of killing
$as'-a's$ with $s''$ if $A$ is not an integral domain.

The ring $S^{-1}A$ is called the localization of $A$ at $S$.
