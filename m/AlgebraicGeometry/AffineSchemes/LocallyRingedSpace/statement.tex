A locally ringed space $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ is a ringed space such that
$\mathcal{O}_{X, p}$ is a local ring (i.e., has a unique maximal
ideal) for every $p \in X$.

A morphism $f\colon (X, \mathcal{O}_X)\to (Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$ of locally ringed spaces is a morphism of ringed spaces such that
such that the induced map $f_p^\#\colon \mathcal{O}_{Y, f(p)} \to \mathcal{O}_{X, p}$ is a local
homomorphism. Here,
\begin{itemize}
	\item the map $f_p^\#$ is defined by $(U, s)\mapsto (f^{-1}(U), f^\#_U(s))$ for
		a section $s \in \mathcal{O}_Y(U)$, and
	\item a local homomorphism $\varphi\colon (A, m_A)\to (B, m_B)$ is a ring homomorphism between local rings such that
		$\varphi^{-1}(m_B) = m_A$. Note that $\varphi(A\setminus m_A) = \varphi(A^\times) \subseteq B^\times = B\setminus m_B$.
		Hence, $\varphi^{-1}(m_B) \subseteq m_A$ is always true, and the opposite
		inclusion is what makes a ring homomorphism local.
\end{itemize}
