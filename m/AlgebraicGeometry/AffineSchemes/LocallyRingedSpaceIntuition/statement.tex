In the case of varities, $\mathcal{O}_{X, p}$ has a unique maximal ideal
$\set{(U, f) \in \mathcal{O}_X(U)\given f(p) = 0}/\sim$, i.e., if $f(p)\neq 0$,
then $f$ is nowhere vanishing on some neighborhood of $p$, so after shrinking
$U$, we can invert $f$.

The local homomorphism condition just follows from the pullback of a function
$\varphi$ vanishing at $f(p)$ vanishes at $p$.
