It is rare in algebraic geometry to work with schemes alone. Rather, we always work
over a base scheme.

Fix a base scheme $S$. Define the category of schemes over $S$ to be the
category whose objects are morphisms $T\to S$ and morphisms are commutative
triangles. This is just the normal comma construction.

We will frequently work with schemes over $\Spec k$, which we will also refer to
as schemes over $k$.

Given two schemes over $S$, $T\to S$ and $X\to S$, we define a $T$-valued point
of $X\to S$ as a morphism $T\to X$ over $S$. We write $X(T)$ for the set of
$T$-valued points.

By Yoneda, the collection of $X(T)$ for every $T$ determines $X$ up to isomorphism.
