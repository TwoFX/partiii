An affine scheme is a locally ringed space that is isomorphic as a locally
ringed space to $(\Spec A, \mathcal{O}_{\Spec A})$ for some ring $A$.

A scheme is a locally ringed space $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ with an open cover
$\set{(U_i, \mathcal{O}_X|_{U_i})}$ such that each $(U_i, \mathcal{O}_X|_{U_i})$
is an affine scheme.  Recall that we have $\mathcal{O}_X|_{U_i}(V) = \mathcal{O}_X(V)$
for $V \subseteq U$ open.
