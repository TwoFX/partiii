Given a short exact sequence of sheaves
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] & \mathcal{F}' \arrow[r] & \mathcal{F} \arrow[r] & \mathcal{F}'' \arrow[r] & 0,
\end{tikzcd}\]
we know that
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	0\ar[r] & \Gamma(X, F')\ar[r] & \Gamma(X, \mathcal{F})\ar[r] & \Gamma(X, \mathcal{F}'')
\end{tikzcd}\]
is exact. Can we extend this to a long exact sequence?

This is indeed possible using the right derived functors of $\Gamma(X, \bullet)$, which
are written as $H^i(X, \bullet)$.
