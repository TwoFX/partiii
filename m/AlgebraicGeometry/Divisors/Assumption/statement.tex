In this chapter, we will use the symbol $(\star)$ for the following assumption: $X$ is a Noetherian
integral scheme over $\Spec k$ which is regular in codimension one, i.e., whenever a local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$
is of dimension one, it is regular, i.e., $\dim_{\mathcal{O}_{X, x}/\mathfrak{m}_x} \mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2 = \dim \mathcal{O}_{X, x}$,
i.e., the dimension of the Zarsiki tangent space to $X$ at $x$ coincides with $\dim \mathcal{O}_{X, x}$.
