A Cartier divisor on $X$ is a global section of $\mathcal{K}_X^\times/\mathcal{O}_X^\times$.

A Cartier divisor is said to be principal if it is in the image of the natural map
$\Gamma(X, \mathcal{K}_X \times)\to \Gamma(X, \mathcal{K}_X^\times/\mathcal{O}_X^\times)$.

Two divisors are linearly equivalent if their difference is principal.

Note that we use additive language for divisors.

We write $\CaCl X$ (the Cartier-class group of $X$) to be the Cartier divisors
modulo principal divisors, i.e., the cokernel of the map
$\Gamma(X, \mathcal{K}_X^\times)\to \Gamma(X, \mathcal{K}_X^\times/\mathcal{O}_X^\times)$.
