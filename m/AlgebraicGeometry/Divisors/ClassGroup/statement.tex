The class group of $X$, written as $\Cl X$, is the cokernel of the homomorphism
$K^\times \to \Div X$, $f\mapsto (f)$.

Two divisors $D, D' \in \Div X$ are called linearly equivalent of there is some
 $f \in K(X)^\times$ such that $(f) = D - D'$. We write $D\sim D'$.
 If $D\sim 0$, i.e., $D = (f)$ for some $f$, we say $D$ is a principal divisor.
 So $\Cl X$ is the group of divisors modulo linear equivalence.
