We have $\mathbb{P}^n\setminus H = D_+(X_i) \cong \mathbb{A}^n_k = \Spec k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$
and $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ is a UFD, so $\Cl \mathbb{A}^n_k = 0$. By the previous result,
we have an exact sequence
\[ \mathbb{Z} \to \Cl \mathbb{P}^n \to \Cl \mathbb{A}^n = 0, \]
and thus $\Cl \mathbb{P}^n$ is generated by $[H]$. It remains to show that the first
map is also injective.

Now
\[ K(\mathbb{P}^n) = k[X_0, \ldots, X_n]_{(0)} = \set{f/g\given f, g \in k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]~\text{homogeneous of the same degree, $g\neq 0$}}/\sim. \]
Thus if $dH \sim 0$, then we would need to have a rational function $f/g$ such that
$(f/g) = dH$. This is only poassible if $d = 0$. To be more precise, $(f/g) = Y_1 - Y_2$,
where $Y_1, Y_2$ are sums of hypersurfaces with the same total degree. This is not
possible, hence injectivity follows.
