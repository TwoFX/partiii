Let $X$ satisfy $(\star)$ and let $Z \subseteq X$ be a proper closed subset and $U = X\setminus Z$ (TODO)

Then
\begin{enumerate}
	\item there is a surjective homomorphism $\Cl X\to \Cl U$ given by
		$\sum n_iY_i\mapsto \sum n_i(Y_i\cap U)$, where $Y_i\cap U$ is interpreted as $-0$
		of $Y_i\cap U = \varnothing$.
	\item If $\codim(Z, X) \geq 2$, then this homomorphism is an isomorphism.
	\item If $Z$ is irreducible of codimension $1$, then we have an exact sequence
		\[ Z\to \Cl X\to \Cl U\to 0, \]
		where the first map sends $1 \mapsto [Z]$.
\end{enumerate}
