Let $X$ satisfy $(\star)$, and $f \in K(X)^\times$. Then the divisor (of zeros
and poles) of $f$, denoted as $(f)$, is
\[ (f) = \sum_{\text{$Y \subseteq X$ prime}} \nu_Y(f)\cdot Y \in \Div X. \]
By the previous lemma, this definition makes sense. Note that we have a map
$K^\times \to \Div X$, $f\mapsto (f)$, and this map is in fact a homomorphism of
groups since $\nu_Y$ is.
