Let $X$ an integral subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^n_k$, where $k$ is algebraically closed.

	Line bundles & Linear systems\\ \midrule
	A line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ & $D \in \CaCl X$ such that $\mathcal{L}\cong \mathcal{O}_X(D)$ \\
	$s \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L})$, $s\neq 0$ & $(s)_0\sim D$ an effective divisor\\
	$\mathbb{P}(\Gamma(X, \mathcal{L})) = (\Gamma(X, \mathcal{L})\setminus\set{0})/k^\times$ &
	A complete linear system $\abs{D}$, the set of all effective $D'$ such that
	$D'\sim D$\\
	$s_0, \ldots, s_n \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L})$ defines a morphism
	$\mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus(n+1)}\to \mathcal{L}$ given by $e_i\mapsto s_i$. If this
	map is surjective, we say $\mathcal{L}$ is generated by global sections and
	we obtain a morphism $X\to \mathbb{P}^n_k$ & A linear subspace $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \abs{D}$
	is called a linear system (think of this as the linear subspace of $\abs{D}$
	spanned by $(s_i)_0$ for $0\leq i\leq n$. We say that $\mathcal{D}$ basepoint-free
	if for every $x \in X$, there is $D' \in \mathcal{D}$ such that $x\notin \Supp D'$
	(if $D' = \sum a_iY_i$ with $a_i > 0$, then $\Supp D' = \bigcup_i Y_i$).
	In this case, $D$ gives a morphism $X\to \mathbb{P}^n$.

	Note: if $\mathcal{D}$ is determined by $s_0, \ldots, s_n$, then $\mathcal{D}$ is
	basepoint-free if and only if $s_0, \ldots, s_n$ generate $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{O}_X(D)$.
	Also the pullbacks of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{P}^n$ give elements of $\mathcal{D}$.\\
	If section of $\mathcal{L}$ induce a closed immersion in some $\mathbb{P}^n_k$,
	we say $\mathcal{L}$ is very ample & If $(D)$ induces a closed immersion, we say
	that $D$ is very ample.\\
	$\mathcal{L}$ is ample if $\mathcal{L}^{\tensor n}$ is very ample for some
	$n > 0$ & $D$ is ample if $nD$ is very ample for some $n>0$. \\ \bottomrule
