Let $\set{U_i}$ be a finite cover such that $U_i\cong \Spec A_i$, where $A_i$
is a Noetherian ring.

If $V_1 \supseteq V_2\supseteq \cdots$ is a decreasing sequence of closed
subsets of $X$, then for every $i$,
$V_1 \cap U_i\supseteq V_2\cap U_i \supseteq \cdots$ is a decreasing sequence
of subsets which are closed in $U_i$. Hence there exist ideals
$I_{i1} \subseteq I_{i2} \subseteq\cdots$ of $A_i$ such that $V_j\cap U_i = V(I_{ij})$
for all $j$. Since $A_i$ is Noetherian, this means that there is some $K_i$ such
that $V_j\cap U_i = V_{K_i} \cap U_i$ for all $j \geq K_i$. Since there are finitely
many $U_i$ and they cover $X$, we can define $K\coloneqq \max_i K_i$ and
for all $j \geq K$ we have $V_j = V_K$, so $X$ is a Noetherian topological space.

Now let $V$ be any closed subset of $X$. If it is irreducible, we are done.
Otherwise, decompose it as the union of two closed subsets. If possible, decompose
these again, and so on. This process yields a rooted binary tree of closed
sets in $X$, but the tree must be finite, since otherwise we would find an infinite
descending sequence of closed sets in $X$ (a binary tree of finite height is necessarily
finite), which does not exist. Hence the tree has
a finite number of leaves, and this is the desired decomposition into irreducible
closed subsets.
