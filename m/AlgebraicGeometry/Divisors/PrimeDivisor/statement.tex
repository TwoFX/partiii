Assume $(\star)$ holds. Then a prime divisor on $X$ is defined as a closed subvariety
(i.e., an irreducible and reduced (equivalently integral) closed subscheme of $X$)
of codimension $1$.

Let $\Div(X)$ be the free abelian group generated by the prime divisors. Let
$K(X)$ be the function field of $X$ (cf. Sheet 2, Exercise 7). Notice that
$K(X)$ is the field of fractions of $A$ whenever $\Spec A \subseteq X$ is an
open affine subset. FOr $Y \subseteq X$ be a prime divisor and let $\eta \in Y$
be the generic point. Then $\dim \mathcal{O}_{X, \eta} = 1$ (this follows from
the fact that $\codim(Y, X) = 1$) and hence we get a valuation
$\nu_Y\colon K(X)^\times \to \mathbb{Z}$ (since $K(X)$ is the field of fractions of
$\mathcal{O}_{X, \eta}$) such that
\[ \mathcal{O}_{X, \eta} = \set{f \in K(X)^\times\given \nu(f)\geq 0}\cup\set{0}. \]
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\nu_Y(\mathfrak{m}_\mu\setminus \mathfrak{m}_\mu^2) = 1$.
