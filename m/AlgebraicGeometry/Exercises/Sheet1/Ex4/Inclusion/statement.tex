For a presheaf $\mathcal{F}$ and an open set $U$, define
\[ \theta_U\colon \mathcal{F}U\to \mathcal{F}^+U;\qquad s\mapsto (p\mapsto s_p). \]
This is obviously a homomorphism of groups. It also defines a morphism of shaves,
because for $s \in \mathcal{F}U$, $V \subseteq U$ and $p \in V$ we have
\[ \theta_U(s)|_V(p) = \theta_U(s)(p) = s_p = (s|_V)_p =  \theta_V(s|V)(p). \]
