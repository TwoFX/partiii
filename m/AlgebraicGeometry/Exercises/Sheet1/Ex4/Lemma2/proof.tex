Uniqueness follows from the previous lemma. For existence, notice that the
$V_p$ cover $U$. Let $p, q \in U$. The $s_{V_p}$ are gluable because their stalks
agree on the intersection, so the conditions of the gluing axiom are satisfied
by the previous lemma. Since talking stalks is compatible with restrictions, the
glued section has the correct stalks.
