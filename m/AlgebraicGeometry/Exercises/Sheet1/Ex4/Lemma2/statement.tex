Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf. Let $U$ be an open set.
Let $s\colon U\to\coprod_{p \in U} \mathcal{F}_p$ such that
for every $p \in U$ we have $s(p) \in \mathcal{F}_p$ and there is an open
$p \in V_p \subseteq U$ together with $s_{V_p} \in \mathcal{F}V_p$ such that
for every $q \in V_p$ we have $(s_{V_p})_q = s(q)$. Then there is a unique
$t \in \mathcal{F}U$ such that $t_q = s(q)$ for every $q \in U$.
