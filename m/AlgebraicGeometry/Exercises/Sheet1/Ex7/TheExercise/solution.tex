Let $f\colon \mathcal{F}\to \mathcal{G}$ be a morphism of sheaves.
By a result from the lecture, $f$ is an isomorphism if and only if
$f_p\colon \mathcal{F}_p\to \mathcal{G}_p$ is an isomorphism for every $p$.
Since $f_p$ is a morphism of abelian groups, this is the case if and only if $f_p$
is injective and surjective for every $p$. By another result from the lecture,
this is the case if and only if $f$ is injective and surjective.
