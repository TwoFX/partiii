Let $X$ be an integral scheme. There is a unique point $\eta$ such that the closure of $\set{\eta}$ is $X$;
this is called the generlic point of $X$. The stalk of $\mathcal{O}_X$ at $\eta$ is a field, called the function
field of $X$, denote by $K(X)$. More precisely, if $U = \Spec A$ is any open affine subset of $X$, then
$K(X)$ is a field of fractions of $A$.
