Let $A = k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ with $k$ algebraically closed. Let $I \subseteq A$
be an ideal. Then the maximal ideals $m$ of  $A$ containing $I$ are in one-to-one
correspondence with $V(I)$ in $\mathbb{A}^n(k)$: by Nulstellensatz, every
maximal ideal is of the form $(X_1 - a_1, \ldots, X_n - a_n)$, which corresponds
to $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ in the old $V(I)$.

The new $V(I)$ now extends this notion of zero set by including other prime
ideals.
