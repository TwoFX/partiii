Let $S$ be a graded ring, i.e., $S = \bigoplus_{d\geq 0} S_d$ with $S_d$ an abelian
group, and we have the product law $S_d\cdot S_{d'} \subseteq S_{d+d'}$.

For example, if $S = k[X_0, \ldots, X_n]$, then we get a grading such that $S_d$
is the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$.

We write $S_+ \coloneqq \bigoplus_{d\geq 1} S_d$, which we call the irrelevant ideal.
