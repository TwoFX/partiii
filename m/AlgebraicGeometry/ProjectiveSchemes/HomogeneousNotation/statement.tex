For $p \in \Proj S$, let
\[ T = \set{f \in S\setminus p\given \text{$f$ is homogeneous}}. \]
Then $T$ is a multiplicateively closed subset of $S$ and let $S_{(p)} \subseteq T^{-1}S$
be the subring of elements of degree $0$, i.e., written in the form $s/s'$ with
$s \in S$ homogeneous, $s' \in T$ with $\deg s = \deg s'$.

For $f \in S$ homogeneous, we write $S_(f) \subseteq S_f$ for the subset of
elements of degree $0$.
