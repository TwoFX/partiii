Let $S = k[X_0, \ldots, X_n]$, but grade by $\deg X_i = w_i$, where
$w_0, \ldots, w_n$ are positive integers. Define weighted projective
space via $W\mathbb{P}^n(w_0, \ldots, w_n) = \Proj S$.

For example, consider $W\mathbb{P}^2(1, 1, 2)$. This has an open cover
$\set{D_+(X_i)}$. We have $D_+(X_2) \cong \Spec S_{(X_2)}$.
Note \[ S_{(X_2)} = k[u\coloneqq\frac{X_0^2}{X_2}, v\coloneqq\frac{X_0X_1}{X_2}, w\coloneqq\frac{X_1^2}{X^2}] \subseteq S_{X_2} \cong k[u, v, w]/(uw-v^2)\]
$\Spec S_{(X_2)}$ then is a quadric cone (an image is missing here).

$D_+(X_0)$ and $D_+(X_1)$ are both isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}_k^2$.
