\begin{enumerate}
	\item In general, it is hard to calculate fibre products. In general,
		$X\times_S Y$ will not be the set-theoretic fibre product, for example
		$\mathbb{A}_k^1\times_{\Spec k}\mathbb{A}_k^1 \cong \Spec k[X]\tensor_k k[X] \cong \Spec k[X, Y] \cong \mathbb{A}_k^2 $.
	\item If we are interested only in varieties, i.e., schemes over a field $k$, the usual
		product of varieties $X\times Y$ wil correspond to $X\times_{\Spec k} Y$.
		More generally, if we are working in the category of schemes over $S$, the
		categorical product is given by $X\times_S Y$.
	\item Given schemes $S, T$ with a morphism $T\to S$ we get a functor from schemes
		over $S$ to schemes over $T$ given by $X\to S\mapsto X\times_S T\to T$. This
		functor is called base change.
\end{enumerate}
