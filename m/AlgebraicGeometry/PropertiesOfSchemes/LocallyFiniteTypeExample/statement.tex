Let $X_i = \Spec k[X_i, Y_i]/(X_iY_i)$, $i \in \mathbb{Z}$. Glue $X_i$ to
$X_{i+1}$ along the open subsets $U_{i, i+1} \subseteq X_i$ given by $D(X_i)$
and $U_{i+1, i} \subseteq X_{i+1}$ given by $D(Y_{i+1})$
via the map
\[ U_{i, i+1}\cong \Spec \left(\frac{k[X_i, Y_i]}{(X_iY_i)}\right)_{X_i} \cong \Spec k[X_i]_{X_i}\to \Spec k[Y_{i+1}]_{Y_{i+1}}\cong U_{i+1, i} \]
induced by the ring homomorphism sending $Y_{i+1}\mapsto X_i^{-1}$.

Do this for all $i$ to get an infinite chain of $\mathbb{P}^1$s.

There is an image missing here.

The $\set{X_i}$ form an open cover of $X$ that has no finite subcover, so $X$ is
not quasicompact and only locally of finite type over $\Spec k$.
