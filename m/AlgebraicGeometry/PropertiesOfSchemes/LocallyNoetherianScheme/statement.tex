Let $X$ be a scheme. We call $X$ locally Noetherian if there is a cover
$\set{U_i}$ of $X$ with $U_i \cong \Spec A_i$ affine and $A_i$ Noetherian.
We call $X$ Noetherian if the cover may be taken to be finite.

As an example, the scheme $\Spec k[X_1, X_2, \ldots]$ is not locally Noetherian,
and this is not obvious.

However, it is possible to show that $X$ is locally Noetherian if and only if
for every affine subset $U \subseteq X$, $U \cong \Spec A$ we have that  $A$ is
Noetherian.
