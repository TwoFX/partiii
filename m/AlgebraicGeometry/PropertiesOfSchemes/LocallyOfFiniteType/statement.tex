A morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ of schemes is called locally of finite type
if there is a covering of $Y$ by affine open sets $\set{V_i \cong \Spec B_i}$
such that for each $i$, $f^{-1}(V_i)$ can be covered by affine open sets
$\set{U_{ij}\cong \Spec A_{ij}}$, where each $A_{ij}$ is a finitely generated
$B_i$-algebra. This makes sense:
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=1cm, column sep=1cm]
	U_{ij}\ar[d]& A_{ij}\\
	V_i & B_i.\ar[u]
\end{tikzcd}\]

We say that $f$ is of finite type if for each $i$ the cover $U_{ij}$ may be
taken to be finite.
