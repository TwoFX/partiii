Take $X = \Spec k[X, Y]/(XY)$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $X$ is not integral because $\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) \cong k[X, Y]/(XY)$
		is not an integral domain, as $X\times Y = 0$.
	\item We can show that
		$X$ is reduced, and this follows from the fact that the global sections
		to not have nilpotents (TODO: how?).
	\item $X$ is not irreducible, since $X = V(X) \cup V(Y)$. We can think of
		$X$ as the union of the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis.
\end{itemize}
