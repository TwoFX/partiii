A topological space $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal
$\Delta \subseteq X\times X$ is closed.


For example, if $X$ is
the Euclidean line with two origins is not Hausdorff, since every open set containing
one origin also contains the other.
The space $X\times X$ is $\mathbb{R}^2$ with doubled axes and four origin. The
diagonal $\Delta$ only contains two of the origins. But the other two origins
are still contained in the closure of $\Delta$. There is a picture missing here.
