If $R$ is a valuation ring, it has $0$ as a prime ideal and a unique maximal
ideal. The point $\set{0}$ is dense (i.e., its closure is all of $\Spec R$).
The closed point $\mathfrak{m}$ is in some sense a limit point. Very roughtly,
the \enquote{at most one} condition in the valuative criterion correesponds to
the fact that a sequence has at most one limit in a Hausdorff space.
