Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism of schemes, where $X$ is Noetherian. Then
$f$ is separated if and only if the following condition holds.

For any field $K$ and any valuation ring $R \subseteq K$ (i.e., for any $0\neq x \in K$,
$x \in R\vee x^{-1} \in R$), let $T = \Spec R$, $U = \Spec K$, and let $U\to T$
be the morphism induced by the inclusion $R\to K$.
Given a commutative diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	U\ar[r]\ar[d, "i"] & X\ar[d, "f"]\\
	T\ar[r] & Y
\end{tikzcd}\]
there exists at most one morphism $i'\colon T\to X$ making the diagram commute.
