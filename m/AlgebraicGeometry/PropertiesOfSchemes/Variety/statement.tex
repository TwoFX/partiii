Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. A variety over $k$ is a scheme $X$
over $\Spec k$ which is integral and $X\to \Spec k$ is of finite type.

Note that since $\Spec k$ only has one point, being of finite type just means
that $X$ can be covered by a finite number of open affines $U_i = \Spec A_i$ with
$A_i$ a finitely generated $k$-algebra. The $A_i$ must be integral domains.
In particular, this forces $A_i = k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I$, where $I$ is a prime
ideal.

Note this this still allows a \enquote{non-Hausdorff} scheme $\mathbb{A}^1\cup \mathbb{A}^1$
obtained by gluing $D(X)$ to $D(X)$ (this is the line with two origins).
