$f_p$ is injective for every $p$ if and only if $\ker f_p = 0$ for every $p$
if and only if $(\ker f)_p = 0$ for every $p$. By identity this is equivalent
to $\ker f = 0$ (TODO: check this!), which is the definition of injectivity.

Similarly $f_p$ is surjective for every $p$ iff $(\im f)p = \mathcal{G}_p$ for every $p$
iff $(\im f)_p = \mathcal{G}_p$ for every $p$ iff $\Im f = \mathcal{G}$ (TODO: check this),
but this is the definition of surjectivity.
