Let $f\colon \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ be a morphism of presheaves on a space
$X$. We define
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The presheaf kernel of $f$, $\ker f$, is the presheaf given by
		\[ (\ker f)(U)\coloneqq \ker f_U. \]
		One should check that this is a presheaf.

	\item The presheaf cokernel of $f$, $\coker f$, is the presheaf given by
		\[ (\coker f)(U)\coloneqq \coker f_U. \]

	\item The presheaf image $\im f$ is the presheaf given by
		\[ (\im f)(U) = \im f_U. \]
\end{enumerate}
