If $f\colon \set{p} \to X$ is an inclusion of a point, then $f^{-1}\mathcal{G}$ is the
sheaf on the one-point space given by $\mathcal{G}_p$.

More generally, if $i\colon Z\to X$ is the inclusion of a subspace, we often write
$\mathcal{F}|_Z\coloneqq i^{-1}\mathcal{F}$. If $Z$ is open in $X$, then we have
\[ F|_Z(U) \cong \mathcal{F}U. \]
