Let $f\colon \mathcal{F}\to \mathcal{G}$ be a morphism of sheaves. The sheaf kernel of $f$
is just the presheaf kernel.

The sheaf cokernel is the sheaf associated to the presheaf cokernel of $f$.

The sheaf image is the sheaf associated to the presheaf image of $f$.

We can check that these notions give kernels, cokernels and images in the category
of sheaves.
