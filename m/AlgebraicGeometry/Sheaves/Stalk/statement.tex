Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf on $X$ and  let $x \in X$. Then the stalk of
$\mathcal{F}$ at $x$ is $\mathcal{F}_x\coloneqq\set{(U, s)\given U \subseteq X~\text{open neighborhood at $x$}, s \in \mathcal{F}U}/\sim$,
w here $(U, s)\sim (V, s')$ if there is a neighborhood $W \subseteq U\cap V$ of $x$ such that
$s|_W = s'|_W$. An equivalence class of a pair $(U, s)$ is called a germ.
