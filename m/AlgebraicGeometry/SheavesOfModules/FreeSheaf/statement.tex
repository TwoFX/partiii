We call a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules free if it is isomorphic to
$\bigoplus_{i \in I}\mathcal{O}_X$ for some index set $I$. If $I$ is finite of
cardinality $r$, then we say that $\mathcal{F}$ has rank $r$.

A sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ is called locally free of rank $r$, if there exists an
open cover $\set{U_i}$ of $X$ such that $\mathcal{F}|_{U_i}$ is free (as a $\mathcal{O}_X|_{U_i}$-module!) of rank $r$
for each $i$.

We say that $\mathcal{F}$ is a line bundle if it is rank $1$.

Often, more generally, one might refer to a rank $r$ locally free sheaf as a
rank $r$ vector bundle.
