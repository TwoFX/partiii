A locally free sheaf is always quasi-coherent and it is coherent if it is of
finite rank: if $U \subseteq X$ (where $U\cong \Spec A$) satisfies
$\mathcal{F}|_U \cong \bigoplus_{i \in I} \mathcal{O}_U$,
then $\mathcal{F}|_U = \widetilde{\bigoplus_{i \in I} A}$

Kernels, cokernels, images, tensor products and hom sheaves of quasi-coherent
sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules are themselves quasi-coherent.

This follows since these operations commute with $\tilde{\cdot}$, e.g.,
$\ker (\tilde{M_1}\to \tilde{M_2}) = \widetilde{\ker(M_1\to M_2)}$,
$\tilde{M_1}\tensor_{\mathcal{O}_X} \tilde{M_2} = \widetilde{M_1\tensor_A M_2}$,
$\Hom_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\tilde{M_1}, \tilde{M_2}) = \widetilde{\Hom_A(M_1, M_2)}$

Should check (TODO) that a morphism of sheaves is always induced by an underlying morphism of
modules (look at global sections).
