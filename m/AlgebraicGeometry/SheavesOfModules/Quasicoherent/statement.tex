Let $X$ be a scheme and $\mathcal{F}$ a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules on $X$. We say that $\mathcal{F}
$ is quasi-coherent, if $X$ can be covered with affines $U_i = \Spec A_i$ such that
$\mathcal{F}|_{U_i} \cong \tilde{M_i}$ for some $A_i$-module $M_i$.

We say that $\mathcal{F}$ is coherent if each $M_i$ can be taken to be finitely generated.
