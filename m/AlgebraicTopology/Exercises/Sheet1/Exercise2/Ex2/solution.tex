$H^0(X; \mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the kernel of the map
\begin{align*}
	\partial^*\colon \Hom(C_0, \mathbb{Z})&\to \Hom(C_1, \mathbb{Z})\\
	f&\mapsto (\sigma \mapsto f(\partial \sigma)).
\end{align*}

We may think of $1$-simplices as paths $\sigma\colon[0, 1]\to X$, so
$f \in \ker\partial^*$ is equivalent to the fact that for every $\sigma\colon [0, 1]\to X$
we have \[ 0 = \partial^*(f)(\sigma) = f(\partial \sigma) = f(\sigma(1)) - f(\sigma(0)). \]
Invoking the universal property of free abelian groups,
\[ \Hom(C_0, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \Hom(X, \mathbb{Z}), \]
so $H^0(X; \mathbb{Z})$ is in bijection with the functions $X\to \mathbb{Z}$ which
are constant on the path components of $X$.

Let $X$ be a space with a countably infinite number of path components
(e.g., $\mathbb{N}$ with the discrete topology) and let $P$ denote the set of
path components. Then
$H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \bigoplus_{p \in P} \mathbb{Z}$, while
$H_0(X; \mathbb{Z})\cong \prod_{p \in P} \mathbb{Z}$. The former is countable,
while the latter is not, so in particular they are not isomorphic.
