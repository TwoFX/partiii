\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \ldots
	\item There is only one surjective map $\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}/2$; it
		sends $1\mapsto 1$. The kernel of this map is $\mathbb{Z}$, so the image
		of $\alpha$ is $2\mathbb{Z}$. The image of any map $\alpha\colon \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$
		is $\alpha(1)\mathbb{Z}$, so we find that $\alpha$ is the map $n \mapsto 2n$.
		The kernel of this map is trivial, so the image of the map
		$G \to \mathbb{Z}$ is trivial, but that map is injective, so $G$ is
		a trivial group.
	\item Defining $H\coloneqq G\oplus \mathbb{Z}/2$, we find that
		$H/\im\alpha \cong \mathbb{Z}/4$, which in particular means that
		$\abs{H}=16$, so $\abs{G} = 8$. Since $\alpha$ is injective,
		$\alpha(1)$ is an element of order $4$. The right hand map sends
		$\alpha(1)$ to $0$.
