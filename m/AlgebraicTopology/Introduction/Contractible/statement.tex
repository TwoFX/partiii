The inclusion $f\colon \set{0}\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a homotopy equivalence, the homotopy
inverse being the constant map $g\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \set{0}$. Indeed,
$f \circ g\simeq \id_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ via $F(t, v)\coloneqq tv$ and
 $g \circ f = \id_{\set{0}}$.

A space that is homotopy equivalent to a point is called contractible.
