We say that $f\colon X\to Y$ is a homotopy equivalence if there is some
$g\colon Y\to X$ such that $f\circ g\simeq \id_Y$, $g \circ f\simeq \id_X$.
The map  $g$ is called a homotopy inverse for $f$. If there is a homotopy
equivalence, we say that $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy equivalence and write
$X\simeq Y$. This is an equivalence relation.
