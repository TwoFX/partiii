If $g\colon FA\to B$, then consider the square
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	(FA\to FA)\ar[r]\ar[d] & (A\to GFA)\ar[d]\\
	(FA\to B)\ar[r] & A\to GB.
\end{tikzcd}\]
Along the top right $1_{FA}$ is mapped to $\eta_A$ and then to
$Gg \circ \eta_A$. Along the bottom left, $1_{FA}$ is mapped to
$g$ and then to the morphism corresponding to $g$. Hence we have the the
morphism corresponding with $g$ is precisely $Gg \circ \eta_A$, i.e.,
if $f = Gg \circ \eta_A$, then $f$ must correspond to $g$.
