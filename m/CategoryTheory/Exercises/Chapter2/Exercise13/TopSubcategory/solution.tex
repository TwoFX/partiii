For (a), we just need to notice that $F$ is fully faithful, so it induces a
bijection between the sets of morphisms $S\to S$ and $FS \to FS$. Since $S$ is
determined up to isomorphism by having exactly three endomorphisms, the claim
follows.

The proof of (b) is entirely analogous to the proof of 2.13(ii).
