Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a full subcategory of $\mathsf{Top}$ containing the singleton
space $1$ and the Siperpi≈Ñski space $S$ and let $F$ be an automorphism of $\mathcal{C}$.
Then
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item we have $FS\cong S$,
	\item there is a unique natural isomorphism $\alpha\colon U\to UF$, where
		$U\colon \mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Set}$ is the forgetful functor,
	\item if $\mathcal{C}$ contains a space in which not every union of closed sets
		is closed, then $\alpha_S$ is continuous, and
	\item $F$ is uniquely naturally isomorphic to the identity functor.
\end{enumerate}
