Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the full subcategory of $\mathsf{Ab}$ whose objects
are groups having no elements of order $4$ (though they may have elements of
order $2$). Then
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item multiplication by $2$ is a regular monomorphism $\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$,
	\item multiplication by $4$ is not a regular monomorphism $\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$,
	\item there is a pair of morphisms $(f, g)$ such that $gf$ is regular monix but $f$
		is not.
\end{enumerate}
