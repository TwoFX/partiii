Let $f\colon A\to B$, $g\colon B\to C$ be two morphisms.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item If $f$ and $g$ are monic, then $gf$ is monic,
	\item If $f$ and $g$ are strong monic, then $gf$ is strong monic,
	\item If $f$ and $g$ are split monic, then $gf$ is split monic,
	\item If  $gf$ is monic, then $f$ is monic,
	\item If  $gf$ is strong monic, then $f$ is strong monic,
	\item If  $gf$ is split monic, then $f$ is split monic.
\end{enumerate}
