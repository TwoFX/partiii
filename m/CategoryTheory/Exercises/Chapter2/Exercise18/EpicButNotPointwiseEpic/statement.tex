Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the full subcategory of the category $\mathcal{C}$ in
Exercise 2.15 with objects $A$, $B$ and $D$, and let $\mathsf{2}$ be the
category with objects $0$ and $1$ and one non-identity morphism
$0\to 1$. Find an example of a morphism in the functor category $[\mathsf{2}, D]$
which is epic but not pointwise epic.
