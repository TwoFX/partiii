Since the terminal object in the category of rings is the zero ring, which is
noetherian, by induction it suffices to show that if $R$ and $S$ are noetherian,
then $R \times S$ is noetherian.

Let $I$ be an ideal of $R \times S$. We have to show that $I$ is finitely generated.
By the Lemma, $I = I_1 \times I_2$ for an ideal $I_1$ of $R$ and an ideal
$I_2$ of $S$. Since $R$ and $S$ are noetherian, $I_1 $ is finitely generated, say
by $r_1, \ldots, r_n$ and so is $I_2$, say by $s_1, \ldots, s_m$. Then if
$(r, s) \in I_1\times I_2$, we have
\[ (r, s) = (\sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_ir_i, \sum_{i = 1}^m\lambda_i's_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^n(\lambda_i, 0)(r_i, 0) + \sum_{i = 1}^m(0, \lambda_i')(0, s_i), \]
so $I_1\times I_2$ is finitely generated by $(r_1, 0), \ldots, (r_n, 0), (0, s_1), \ldots, (0, s_n)$.
