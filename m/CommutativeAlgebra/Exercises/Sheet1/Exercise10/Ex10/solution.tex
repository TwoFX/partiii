Let $r \in J(A)$ and $s \in A$. Then $rs \in J(A)$, so $rs$ is contained in
every maximal ideal of $A$. If $1-rs$ were contained in a maximal ideal $M$,
then we would have $1 \in M$, a contradiction. So $1-rs$ is not contained in any
maximal ideal, so $(1-rs)$ is not contained in any maximal ideal, so we must have
$(1 - rs) = (1)$, hence $1 - rs$ is a unit.

Conversely, assume that $1-rs$ is a unit for every $s$, and let $M$ be a maximal
ideal of $A$. Suppose that $r \notin M$. Then $A = M + Ar$, so we find
$m \in M$ and  $s \in A$ such that $1 = m + rs$, but then $m = 1 - rs$ is a unit,
a contradiction. Hence $r \in M$ and therefore $r \in J(R)$.
