Let $n \in N$. By surjectivity of the induced map, we find $m \in M$ such that
$\theta(m) + IN = n + IN$. Hence we find $i \in I$ and $n_1 \in N$ such that
$\theta(m) = n + in_1$, hence $n + \theta(M) = i(-n_1) + \theta(M)$. Since
$n$ was arbitrary, we conclude
\[ \frac{N}{\theta(M)} \subseteq I\frac{N}{\theta(M)} \subseteq J(A)\frac{N}{\theta(M)} \subseteq \frac{N}{\theta(M)}. \]
Since $N$ is finitely generated, so is $N/\theta(M)$, and by Nakayama's lemma,
we must have $N/\theta(M) = 0$, so $\theta$ is surjective.
