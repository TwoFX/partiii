Consider the chain
\[ A \supseteq P_1 \supseteq P_1P_2 \supseteq \cdots \supseteq P_1\cdots P_n = 0. \]
The $A$-module $A_i\coloneqq P_1\cdots P_i/P_1\cdots P_{i+1}$ is
an $A/P_{i+1}$-vector space in the obvious way.
If $A$ is noetherian or artinian, then so is $A_i$ (since it is a quotient of a submodule
of $A)$, and
by part (iii) we obtain a composition series for $A_i$, using
that an $A$-submodule is the same thing as a $A/P_{i+1}$-submodule.

Pulling back the composition series along the projection for every $i$ and stitching
together the results, we obtain a composition series for $A$. Again by part (i),
we find that $A$ is both noetherian and artinian.
