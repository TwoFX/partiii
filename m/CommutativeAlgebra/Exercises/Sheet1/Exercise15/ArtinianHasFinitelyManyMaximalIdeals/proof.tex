Otherwise, let $q_1, q_2, \ldots$ denote pairwise distinct maximal ideals
of $A$. Define $Q_n\coloneqq \bigcap_{i=1}^n q_i$. Then
$Q_n \supsetneq Q_{n+1}$, since otherwise we would have $Q_n \subseteq q_{n+1}$, but
by the preceding lemma and primality of $q_{n+1}$, this would imply that
$q_i \subseteq q_{n+1}$ for some $i\leq n$, hence $q_i = q_{n+1}$, which is
not the case. Therefore, the $Q_i$ form a strictly descending chain, which cannot
exist since $A$ is artinian.
