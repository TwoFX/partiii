By the second lemma, $A$ has finitely many maximal ideals $q_1, \ldots, q_n$.
By a result from the lecture, since $A$ is artinian, we have $N(A) = J(A)$, hence
$\sqrt{0} = \bigcap_{i = 1}^n q_i = \prod_{i = 1}^n q_i$, where we have used the
first lemma in the second step. Define $Q_m\coloneqq \prod_{i = 1}^n q_i^m = \sqrt{0}^m$.
The $Q_i$ form a decreasing chain of ideals. Since $A$ is artinian, this chain
terminates, say at $Q_k$. We claim that $Q_k = 0$. Indeed, assume that there
is some $0\neq a \in Q_k$. Since $a \in \sqrt{0}$, $a_\ell = 0$ for some $\ell$.
But then...?
