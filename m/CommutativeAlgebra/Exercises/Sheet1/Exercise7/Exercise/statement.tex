Let $M$ be a noetherian $A$-module and $\theta$ be an endomorphism.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item If $\theta$ is surjective, then it is an isomorphism.
	\item If $M$ is artinian and $\theta$ is injective, then it is an
		isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}

[Hint: in (i) consider the submodules $\ker\theta^n$; in (ii), consider the quotient
modules $\coker\theta^n$.]
