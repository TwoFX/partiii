If $S^{-1}M = 0$, then for all $m \in M$ we have
$(m, 1) \sim (0, 1)$, hence we find $s \in S$ such that $sm = 0$. In partiular,
if $M$ is generated by $m_1, \ldots, m_n$, we find $s_i$ such that $s_im_i = 0$.
Define  $s\coloneqq \prod s_i$, then for any $m \in M$, we find $r_i \in R$ such
that $sm = s(r_1m_1 + \cdots + r_nm_n) = 0$, so $sM = 0$.

The converse direction is trivial.
