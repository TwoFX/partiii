The proof of the distributive property for tensor products generalizes without
changes to yield an isomorphism
\begin{align*}
	A\tensor \bigoplus_i M_i &\to \bigoplus_i A\tensor M_i\\
	a \tensor m_i \mapsto a\tensor m_i,
\end{align*}
where $a \in A$ and $m_i \in M_i$.

Since a sequence of direct sums of maps is exact if and only if the corresponding
sequences are exact, the claim follows.
