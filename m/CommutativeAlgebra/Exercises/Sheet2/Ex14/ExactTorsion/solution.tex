It is obvious that $f|_{T(M')}$ is injective and that
$\im f|_{T(M')}$ is contained in $\ker g|_{T(M)}$.

Let $m \in \ker g|_{T(M)}$. By exactness of the original sequence, we find
$m' \in M'$ such that $f(m') = m$. Since $m \in T(M)$, we find
$0\neq r \in A$ such that $0 = rm = rf(m') = f(rm')$. By injectivity of
$f$, we conclude $rm' = 0$, so $m' \in T(M')$, so $m = f|_{T(M')}(m')$, so
$m \in \im f|_{T(M')}$.
