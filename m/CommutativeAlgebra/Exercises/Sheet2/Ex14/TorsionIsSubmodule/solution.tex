If $m \in T(M)$, i.e., we find $0\neq r \in A$ such that $rm = 0$ and $s \in A$,
then $sm \in T(M)$, since $rsm = srm = s0 = 0$.

If $m, n \in T(M)$, i.e., we find $0\neq r, s \in A$ such that $rm  = 0 = sn$,
then $rs\neq 0$ since $A$ is an integral domain, so $m+n \in T(M)$, since
$rs(m + n) = srm + rsn = 0$.
