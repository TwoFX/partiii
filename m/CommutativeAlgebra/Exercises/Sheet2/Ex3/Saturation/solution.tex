Define $S'$ as the complement of the unions of the prime ideals which do not
meet $S$. The set $S'$ is multiplicatively closed (since the ideals are prime)
and saturated by (i). Furthermore, by definition have $R \setminus S' \subseteq R\setminus S$,
hence $S \subseteq S'$.

Let $S''$ be a saturated multiplicatively closed subset satisfying $S \subseteq S''$.
By (i), $R\setminus S''$ is a union of prime ideals $p_i$. Let $p_i \subseteq R\setminus S'' \subseteq R\setminus S$
be one of these prime ideals. Then $p_i\cap S = \varnothing$, so $p_i \subseteq R\setminus S'$.
Hence we have $R\setminus S'' \subseteq R\setminus S'$, so
$S' \subseteq S''$, completing the proof that $S'$ is minimal.
