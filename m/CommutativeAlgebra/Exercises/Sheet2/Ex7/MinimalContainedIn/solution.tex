Let $a \in S_0$ be a non-zero-divisor and let $S$ be a maximal element of $\Sigma$.
Then $SM_a$ cannot contain $0$, since $S$ does not contain $0$ and $M_a$
does not contain zero divisors. Hence $S \subseteq SM_a \in \Sigma$, which
implies $SM_a = S$ by maximality. In particular, $a \in S$, so $S_0 \subseteq S$
for every maximal element $S$ of $\Sigma$.

Now if $\mathfrak{p}$ is a minimal prime ideal, then $R\setminus \mathfrak{p}$ is a maximal
element of $\Sigma$. Hence we have $S_0 \subseteq R\setminus \mathfrak{p}$. Taking
complements, we obtain $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq R \setminus S_0 = D$ as required.
