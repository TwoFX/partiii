\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item $S_0$ is the largest multiplicatively closed subset of $R$ for which
		the homomorphism $R\to S_0^{-1}R$ is injective.
	\item Every element in $S_0^{-1}R$ is either a zero-divisor or a unit.
	\item Every ring in which every non-unit is a zero-divisor is equal to its
		total ring of fractions satisfies that $R\to S^{-1}_0R$ is bijective.
