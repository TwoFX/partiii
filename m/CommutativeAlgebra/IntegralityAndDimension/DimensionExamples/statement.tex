\begin{itemize}
	\item An artinian ring has dimension $0$ (since all prie ideals are maximal).
		Conversely, it is possible to show that any noetherian ring of dimension $0$
		is artinian.
	\item We have $\dim \mathbb{Z} = 1$. Indeed, a chain of maximal length must be of the
		form $0 \subsetneq (p)$, where $p$ is a prime number. Also, $\dim k[X] = 1$
		is $k$ is a field. THese are examples of Dedekind rings, i.e., integrally
		closed domains of dimension $1$. Dedekind rings are essential ingredients of
		the theory of algebraic curves and number theory.
	\item The dimension of $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ is at least $n$, because we have
		the chain of prime ideals
		\[ 0 \subsetneq (X_1) \subsetneq (X_2)\subsetneq\cdots\subsetneq (X_1, \ldots, X_n). \]
		Indeed, if $k$ is a field, it is possible to show that the dimension is exactly
		$n$. To prove this, we need some results about the relationship between chains
		of prime ideals in subrings and chains in the whole ring under some cindition
		relating the subring to the larger rung.
