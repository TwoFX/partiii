Let $a$ be a non-unit and $\mathfrak{p}$ a minimal prime over $(a)$. The
localisation $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ has the unique maximal ideal
$\mathfrak{p}_{\mathfrak{p}} = S^{-1}\mathfrak{p}$ (with $S = R\setminus \mathfrak{p}$)
and it is a minimal prime over $S^{-1}(a) = (a)_{\mathfrak{p}}$ (2.5!). Even
further, we have $\hgt(\mathfrak{p}R_{\mathfrak{p}}) = \hgt(\mathfrak{p})$ (2.5 again),
so we may replace $R$ by $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$, i.e., we are allowed to assume that
$R$ is local with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}$.

Suppose $\hgt(\mathfrak{p}) > 1$, i.e., we find prime ideals $\mathfrak{q}, \mathfrak{q}'$
such that $\mathfrak{q}' \subsetneq \mathfrak{q}\subsetneq \mathfrak{p}$. The
ring $R/(a)$ is local with the unique maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}/(a)$. Now a prime
ideal in $R/(a)$ pulls back to a prime between $(a)$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ in $R$,
so we conclude that $\mathfrak{p}/(a)$ is actually the only non-zero prime of $R/(a)$.
Thus $N(R/(a)) = \mathfrak{p}/(a)$ is nilpotent (1.21). Pulling this back, we conclude
that $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq (a)$ for some $n$.
