Let $R$ be a noetherian ring.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Each prime $\mathfrak{p}$ of $R$ has finite height.
	\item If $R$ is local with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ and $n$ is the minimal
		number of generators of $\mathfrak{m}$, then $\dim R \leq n$. Furthermore,
		$n = \dim_{R/\mathfrak{m}}\mathfrak{m}^2/\mathfrak{m}$.
\end{enumerate}
