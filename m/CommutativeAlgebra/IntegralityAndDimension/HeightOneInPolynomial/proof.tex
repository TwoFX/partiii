Certainly such an ideal is prime, since $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ is a unique factorization
domain.

If $\mathfrak{p}$ is a nonzero prime ideal, it contains such an $(f)$, since
if $g \in \mathfrak{p}$, then by primality, it contains at least one of its irreducible
factors. This means that if a prime has height $1$, then it must be of the form $(f)$
with $f$ irreducible.

Conversely, suppose that $f$ is irreducible, and
$0 \subsetneq \mathfrak{p} \subseteq (f)$ for some
prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$. Then by what we just saw, we find an irreducible $h$
with $(h)\subseteq \mathfrak{p}$. In particular, $h \in (f)$. Since $h$ is irreducible,
we must have $(h) = (f)$, so $\mathfrak{p} = (f)$, so $\hgt((f)) = 1$ as claimed.
