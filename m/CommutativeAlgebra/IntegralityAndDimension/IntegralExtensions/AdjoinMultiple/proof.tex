We do induction on $m$. The case $m = 1$ is just 4.7. If the claim is true for
$m$, since $x_{m+1}$ is integral over $R$, it is definitely integral over
$R[x_1, \ldots, x_m]$. Hence $R[x_1, \ldots, x_{m+1}$ is a finitely generated
$R[x_1, \ldots, x_m]$-module, say with generators $z_1, \ldots, z_t$. By
the inductive hypothesis, $R[x_1, \ldots, x_m]$ is finitely generated as an $R$-module,
say by $y_1, \ldots, y_{\ell}$. Then $R[x_1, \ldots, x_{m+1}]$ is generated as
an $R$-module by elements of the form $z_iy_j$ with $1\leq i\leq t$ and
$1\leq y\leq\ell$.
