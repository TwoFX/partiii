The next two theorems are due to Cohen and Seidelberg (1946) and are
called the \enquote{going up} and \enquote{going down} theorems. They
allow us to move from chains of prime ideals of $R$ to such chains in
$T$, where $R \subseteq T$ is an integral extension. The second theorem requires
stronger conditions.
