Take a chain $\mathfrak{q}_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{q}_n$ of
primes in $T$. Intersection with $R$ yields a chain
$\mathfrak{p}_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_n$ of primes in $R$,
with $\mathfrak{q}_i \cap R = \mathfrak{p}_i$, and this chain
is strict by 4.15. Thus $\dim R\geq \dim T$.

Conversely, if $\mathfrak{p}_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_n$ is
a chain of primes in $R$. Then 4.16 yields $\mathfrak{q}_0$ lying over
$\mathfrak{p}_0$, which we can complete using the going-up theorem. This
chain is obviously strictly increasing, hence $\dim R\leq\dim T$.
