Let $R \subseteq T$ be an integral extension integral domains,
such that $R$ is integrally closed.
Let $\mathfrak{p}_1\supseteq \cdots \supseteq \mathfrak{p}_n$ be a chain
of prime ideals of $R$ and $\mathfrak{q}_1 \supseteq \cdots \supseteq \mathfrak{q}_m$
($m < n$) be a chain of prime ideals of $T$ such that $\mathfrak{q}_i\cap R = \mathfrak{p}_i$
for $1\leq i\leq m$.

Then the chain of $\mathfrak{q}$s extends to a chain $\mathfrak{q}_1\supseteq \cdots \supseteq \mathfrak{q}_n$
with $\mathfrak{q}_i\cap R = \mathfrak{p}_i$ ($1\leq i\leq n$).
