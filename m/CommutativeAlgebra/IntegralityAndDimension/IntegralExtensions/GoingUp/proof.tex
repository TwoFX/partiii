By induction, it will be enough to consider the case $n = 2$, $m = 1$.
Write $\overline{R}$ for $R/\mathfrak{p}_1$ and $\overline{T}$ for $T/\mathfrak{q_1}$.
Then we have an integral extension $\overline{R} \subseteq \overline{T}$, using
the fact that $\mathfrak{q}_1\cap R = \mathfrak{p}_1$ and 4.12(i). By the
Lying over theorem, we find a prime ideal $\overline{\mathfrak{q}_2}$ of
$\overline{T}$ such that $\overline{\mathfrak{q}_2} \cap \overline{R} = \overline{\mathfrak{p}_2}$.
Lifting out of the quotient yields a prime ideal $\mathfrak{q}_2$ of $T$ with
$\mathfrak{q}_1 \subseteq \mathfrak{q}_2$ and $\mathfrak{q}_2 \cap R = \mathfrak{p}_2$.
