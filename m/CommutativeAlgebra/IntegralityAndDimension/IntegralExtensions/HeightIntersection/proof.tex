Take a chain $\mathfrak{q}_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{q}_n = \mathfrak{q}$
in $\Spec(T)$. As above this yields a strict chain of prime ideals in $R$
by defining $\mathfrak{p}_i\coloneqq \mathfrak{q}_i\cap R$. Hence,
$\hgt(\mathfrak{q}\cap R) \geq \hgt(\mathfrak{q})$.

Conversely, if we have a chain of prime ideals ending in $\mathfrak{q}\cap R$,
then $\mathfrak{q}$ is the beginning of a lift which can be completed using
4.18. Hence $\hgt(\mathfrak{q}\cap R)\leq \hgt(\mathfrak{q})$.
