The subring of integral elements over $R$ in $S$ is called the integral
closure of $R$ in $S$. If the integral closure  of $R$ in $S$ is just $R$, then
we say that $R$ is integrally closed in $S$. If the integral closure is the
entirety of $S$, we say that $S$ is integral over $R$.

If $R$ is an integral domain, we say that $R$ is integrally closed if it is
integrally closed in its field of fractions.
