\begin{itemize}
	\item  As we say, $\mathbb{Z}$ is integrally closed.
	\item $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ is integrally closed (in $k(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$).
	\item If $K$ is an algebraic number field with $[K:\mathbb{Q}]<\infty$, then
		the integral closure of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $K$ is the ring of integers
		$\mathcal{O}_K$.
	\item Being integrally closed is a local property. This will be proved later.
\end{itemize}
