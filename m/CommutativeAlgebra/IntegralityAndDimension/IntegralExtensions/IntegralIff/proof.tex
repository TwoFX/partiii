If $x$ is integral, i.e., $f(x) = 0$ for monic $f \in R[X]$, we can write
$x^{n+j} = -(r_{n-1}x^{n+j-1} + \cdots + r_0x^j)$ for all $j\geq 0$, where
$\deg f = n$. Hence, $R[X]$ is generated as an $R$-module by
$1, x, \ldots, x^{n-1}$. This shows that (i) implies (ii).

Trivially, (ii) implies (iii).

Finally, let $y_1, \ldots, y_n$ generate $T$ as an $R$-module. Then we find
$r_{ij}$ such that $xy_i = \sum_j r_{ij}y_j$. Then
\[ \sum_j (x\delta_{ij}-r_ij)y_j = 0, \]
where $\delta$ is the Kronecker delta. Define a matrix $A$ with coefficients in
$S$ via $a_{ij} = x\delta_{ij} - r_{ij}$. Then what we have just seen means that
$Ay_i = 0$ for all $i$, so in particular $0 = \adj(A)Ay = (\det A)Iy= \det A y$,
where $y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)^\top$. Since the $y_i$ generate $T$, $1$ is a linear
combination of the $y_i$, so we find some row vector $v$ such that
$0 = \det A yv = \det(A) 1 = \det A$. But $\det A_{ij}$ is a monic polynomial
expression in $x$ with coefficients in $R$, so we are done.
