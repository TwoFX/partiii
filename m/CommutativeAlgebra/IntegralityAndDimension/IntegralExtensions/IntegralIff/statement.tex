The following statements are equivalent for an element $x \in S$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item $x$ is integral over $R$,
	\item the ring $R[x]$ (i.e., the subring of $S$ generated by $R$ and $x$) is
		finitely generated as an $R$-module,
	\item $R[x]$ is contained in a subring $T$ of $S$ such that $T$ is a finitely
		generated $R$-module.
\end{enumerate}
