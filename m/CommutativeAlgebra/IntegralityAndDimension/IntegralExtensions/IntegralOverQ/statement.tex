Elements of $\mathbb{Q}$ which are integral over $\mathbb{Z}$ are precisely
the elements of $\mathbb{Z}$: if $x = r/s$ is integral over $\mathbb{Z}$ with
$\gcd(r, s) = 1$, then
\[ 0 = s^nf(x) = r^n + r_{n-1}s + \cdots + r_0s^n = 0 \]
for integers $r_i$. Thus $s\mid r^n$, but since $\gcd(r, s) = 1$, this
means that $s=\pm 1$, hence $x = \pm r \in \mathbb{Z}$.
