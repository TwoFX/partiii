Let $R \subseteq T$ be an integral extension. Let $I \subseteq R$ be an ideal.
Then the integral closure of $I$ in $T$ is the radical $\sqrt{TI}$
(note that $TI$ is an ideal of $T$) and this is closed under addition and
multiplication. In particular, if $R = T$, then the integral closure of
$I$ in $R$ is $\sqrt{I}$.
