Take $x \in S$. By assumption, we have a relation
 $x^n + t_{n-1} +\cdots + t_0 = 0$ with $t_i \in T$. By (4.8), the
 subring $R[t_0, \ldots, t_{n-1}]$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, and
 $x$ is integral over it, so $R[t_0, \ldots, t_{n-1}, x]$ is a finitely
 generated $R[t_0, \ldots, t_{n-1}]$-module. As seen in the proof of (4.8), this
 implies that $R[t_0, \ldots, t_{n-1}, x]$ is a finitely generated $R$-module,
 so by 4.7(iii), $x$ is integral over $R$ as required.
