Let $R \subseteq T$ be rings, $T$ integral over $R$. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime
ideal of $R$. Then there is some prime ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ of $T$ with
$\mathfrak{q} \cap R = \mathfrak{p}$. In this situation, we say that
$\mathfrak{q}$ lies over $\mathfrak{p}$. In other words, the map
$\Spec T\to \Spec R$ is surjective.
