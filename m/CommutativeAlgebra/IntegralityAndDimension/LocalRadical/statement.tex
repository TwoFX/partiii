In 4.31, we showed that the dimensional of a noetherian local ring is at most
the minimum number of generators of the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$.

In fact, by 4.30, if $I$ is any ideal such that $\sqrt{I} = \mathfrak{m}$, then
$\dim R$ is bounded above by the minimal number of generators of $I$ (are we
using 1.24 here?). Even more, we can always find an $I$ such that $\sqrt{I} = \mathfrak{m}$
and the minimal number of generators is exactly the dimension of $R$.
