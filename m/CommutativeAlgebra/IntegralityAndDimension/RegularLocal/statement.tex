A regular local ring is a local ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ such that
$\dim R = \dim_{R/\mathfrak{m}} \mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2$.

It is possible to show that a regular local ring is an integral domain. In geometry,
regular local rings correspond to localisation at non-singular points.
