We will make use of the trace function. There are many ways to define it
(cf. Galois theory). We will use it as a black box with the following
property (cf. Reid 8.13): if $K \subseteq L$ is separable, then the map
$L\times L\to K$ given by $(x, y)\mapsto \Tr(xy)$ is a non-degenerate
symmetric $K$-bilinear form.

Pick a $K$-basis $y_1, \ldots, y_n$ of $L$.
