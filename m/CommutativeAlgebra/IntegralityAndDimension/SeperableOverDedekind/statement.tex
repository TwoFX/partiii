Let $R$ be a noetherian integral domain that is integrally closed in its
field of fractions $K$. Let $L$ be a separable extension over $K$, and let $T_1$
be
the integral closure of $R$ in $L$. Then $T_1$ is a finitely generated $R$-module.

Recall that separability always holds in characteristic $0$.
