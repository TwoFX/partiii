By Noether Normalisation, we find algebraically independent elements
 $x_1, \ldots, x_r \in T$ such that $T$ is integral over $R = k[x_1, \ldots, x_r]$,
This implies that $K$ is algebraic over $k(x_1, \ldots, x_r)$, which in turn
implies that $\trdeg_k(K) = \trdeg_kk(x_1, \ldots, x_r) = r$.
By 4.19, $\dim T = \dim R = \dim k[X_1, \ldots, X_r]$.

Thus, it remains to show that $\dim k[X_1, \ldots, X_r] = r$. We have already
seen that $\dim k[X_1, \ldots, X_r] \geq r$. We will prove equality by induction
on $r$. For $r = 0$ there is nothing to show. Assume $r\geq 1$ and take
a chain $\mathfrak{p}_0 \subsetneq \cdots\subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_s$ of primes in $R$.

Since $R$ is an integral domain, we may assume that $\mathfrak{p}_0 = 0$. Furthermore,
we may assume using Lemma 4.5 that $\mathfrak{p}_1 = (f)$.
