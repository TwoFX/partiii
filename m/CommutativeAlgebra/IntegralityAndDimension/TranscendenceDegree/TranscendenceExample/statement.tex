Let $L = k(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ be the fraction field of $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ and
$f \in k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ an irreducible polynomial. Define $K$ to be
the field of fractions of $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n](f)$. Then we have
$\trdeg_k L = n$, since $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ is a maximal alagebraically independent
set, and $\trdeg K = n-1$, since $K$ is algebraic over $k(X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, X_n)$,
where $X_i$ is a variable that appears in some term in $f$.
