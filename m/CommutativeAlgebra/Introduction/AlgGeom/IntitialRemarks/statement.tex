Recall the fundamental theorem of algebra: a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{C}[X]$ is
determined up to scalar multiples by its zeros up to multiplicity.

Given $f \in \mathbb{C}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ we have a polynomial function
$\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}$ given by $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\mapsto f(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$.

Different polynomials yield different functions, so $\mathbb{C}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$
can be viewed as the ring of polynomial functions on complex addine $n$-space.

Given $I \subseteq \mathbb{C}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$, define the set of common zeros
\[ Z(I) = \set{(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n\given \forall f \in I\colon f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 0 }, \]
called an (affine) algebraic set, which is a subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$.
