Commutative algebra is the study of commutative rings developed from
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
	\item algebraic geometry and
	\item algebraic number theory
\end{enumerate}

In (1) focus is on $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$, the polynomial ring over the field
$k$. In (2) focus is on $\mathbb{Z}$, the ring of rational integers. Modern
development of (1) by Grothendieck encompasses much of (2).

Going back further, Hilbert wrote a series of papers on polynomial invariant
theory, 1888-1893.
