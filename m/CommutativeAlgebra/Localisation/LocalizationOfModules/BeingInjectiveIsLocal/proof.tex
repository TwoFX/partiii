(i) implies (ii) by exactness of localization. It is obvious that (ii) implies
(iii).

Now assume that $\varphi_q$ is injective for all maximal ideals $q$.
The sequence
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	0 \arrow[r] & \ker\varphi \arrow[r, "\iota"] & M \arrow[r, "\varphi"] & N
\end{tikzcd}\]
is exact. Hence
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	0 \arrow[r] & (\ker\varphi)_q \arrow[r, "\iota_q"] & M_q \arrow[r, "\varphi_q"] & N_q
\end{tikzcd}\]
is exact for every maximal ideal $q$. By exactness, $(\ker\varphi)_q$ is
isomorphic to $\ker \varphi_q$, which is trivial by assumption. Hence
$(\ker\varphi)_q$ is trivial for every maximal ideal $q$, so by the previous
result, we have $\ker\varphi = 0$ as required.
