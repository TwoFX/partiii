Using the previous lemma, a chain
$J_1 \subseteq J_2 \subseteq \ldots$ in $S^{-1}R$ lifts to a chain
$I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq \ldots$ in $R$ such that
$J_i = S^{-1}I_i$ for each $i$. Since $R$ is noetherian, the chain
$\set{I_i}$ terminates, so the chain $\set{J_i} = \set{S^{-1}I_i}$ must terminate
as well.
