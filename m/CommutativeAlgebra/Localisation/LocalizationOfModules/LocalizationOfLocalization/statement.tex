Let $p$ be a prime ideal of $R$ and $S$ a multiplicatively closed subset of $R$
such that $S\cap p = \varnothing$. By (2.5), $S^{-1}p$ is a prime ideal of
$S^{-1}R$. Then $(S^{-1}R)_{S^{-1}p}\cong R_p$. In particular, if $q$ is a prime
ideal of $R$ with $p \subseteq q$, then $(R_q)_{p_q} \cong R_p$, by taking
$S = R\setminus q$.
