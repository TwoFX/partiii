Let $k$ be a field and $R$ a $k$-algebra which is also an integral domain.
If $R$ is a finite-dimensonal $k$-vector space, then $R$ is a field: indeed,
if $0\neq r \in R$, then multiplication by $r$ is a $k$-linear map. Since
$R$ is an integral domain, this map is injective, and since  $R$ is finite-dimensional,
every injective map is surjective. Hence we find an inverse of $r$.
