Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, and $R$ a finitely generated $k$-algebra.
Then $N(R) = J(R)$. Thus if $I$ is a radical ideal of $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$
and $R = k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I$ then the intersection of the maximal ideals of $R$
is $0$.

Furthermore, any radical ideal is the intersection of the maximal ideals containing
it.
