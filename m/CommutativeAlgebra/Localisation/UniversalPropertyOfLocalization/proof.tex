We will first show uniqueness. Suppose we have $\alpha\colon S^{-1}R\to T$ satisfying
$\alpha \circ \theta = \varphi$.

Then we have
\begin{align*}
	\forall r \in R\colon \alpha(\frac{r}{1}) &= \alpha(\theta(r)) = \varphi(r),\\
	\forall s \in S\colon \alpha((\frac{s}{1})^{-1})&=\alpha(\frac{s}{1})^{-1} = \alpha(\theta(s))^{-1} = \varphi(s)^{-1}.
\end{align*}
Thus, $\alpha(\frac{r}{s}) = \alpha(\frac{r}{1})\alpha(\frac{1}{s}) = \varphi(r)\varphi(s)^{-1}$ is
uniquely determined by $\varphi$.

For existence, we define $\alpha(\frac{r}{s})\coloneqq \varphi(r)\varphi(s)^{-1}$.
We need to show that this is well-defined. If $\frac{r_1}{s_1}=\frac{r_2}{s_2}$,
then we find $x \in S$ such that $(r_1s_2 - r_2s_1)x = 0$. Applying $\varphi$,
we find $(\varphi(r_1)\varphi(s_2) - \varphi(r_2)\varphi(s_1))\varphi(x) = 0$.
Since $\varphi(x)$ is a unit, we can cancel it and since the $\varphi(s_i)$ are
units, we can rewrite this two the required relation
$\varphi(r_1)\varphi(s_1)^{-1} = \varphi(r_2)\varphi(s_2)^{-1}$.

It is also possible to check that $\alpha$ is indeed a homomorphism of rings.
