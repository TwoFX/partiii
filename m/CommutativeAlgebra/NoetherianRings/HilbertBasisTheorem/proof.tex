We will show that every ideal (i.e., submodule) of $R[X]$ is finitely generated.
Let $I$ be an ideal and let $I_n\coloneqq \set{f \in I\given \deg f\leq n}$.
$0 \in I_n$ and $I_0 \subseteq I_1 \subseteq\cdots$ form an ascending chain.

Define $R_n$ to be the set of coefficients of $X^n$ appearing in elements of $I_n$.

If $a, b \in R_n$, then $a + b \in R_n$ and $ra \in R_n$ for any $r \in R$. Therefore,
$R_n$ is an ideal of $R$.

Furthermore, if $a \in R_n$, then $a \in R_{n + 1}$ by multiplying the corresponding
polynomial by $X$.

Since $R$ is noetherian, the chain $R_0 \subseteq R_1 \subseteq \cdots$ terminates,
so we have $N$ such that $\forall n\geq N\colon R_n = R_N$. Each of
$R_0, \ldots R_N$ is a finitely generated ideal of $R$, say $R_j$ is generated by
$a_{j1}, \ldots, a_{jk_j}$. There are polynomials $f_{j1}, \ldots, f_{jk_j}$
such that $\deg f_{ji} = j$ and leading coefficient of $f_{ji}$ is $a_{ji}$.

We will show that the finite set $\set{f_{jk}\given 0\leq j\leq N, 1\leq k\leq k_j}$
generates $I$.

We will use induction on $\deg f$, where $f \in I$. If $\deg f = 0$, then
$f = a$ for some $a \in R$. By definition of $R_0$, $a \in R_0$, and $a$ is
in the ideal generated by the $f_{0i}$.

Assume next that $0 < \deg f \leq N$ and that the claim is true for smaller degrees.
Let $a$ be the leading coefficient of $f$. $a \in R_n$, so we may write
\[ a = \sum_j r_{nj}a_{nj}. \] Then \[ f - \sum_j r_{nj}f_{nj} \] is in $I$ and of smaller
degree, so is expressible as a linear combination of the $f_{ij}$, so $f$ is
expressible as a linear combination as well.

Finally, assume that $\deg f > N$ and that the claim is true for smaller degrees.
If $a$ is the leading coefficient of $f$, then $a \in R_n = R_N$, so we may write
\[ a = \sum_j r_{Nj}a_{Nj}. \] Then \[ f - X^{n-N} \sum_j r_{Nj}f_{Nj} \] is in $I$ and of smaller
degree, so is expressible as a linear combination of the $f_{ij}$, so $f$ is
expressible as a linear combination as well.
