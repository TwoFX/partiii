If $p$ is a prime ideal of $R$, then $\Ass(R/p) = \set{p}$ Indeed, if $r \in R$,
then there are two cases. If $r \in p$, then $\ann(r + p) = \ann(0) = R$, which is not
prime. Otherwise, if $r\notin p$, then if $0 + p = (s + p)(r + p)$, we have
$rs \in p$, and since $p$ is prime and $r \notin p$, we have $s \in p$. Conversely,
$p$ is trivially contained in the annihilator, and we conclude that
$\ann(r) = p$.
