The converse of the previous theorem fails in general. For example,
take
$R = k[X, Y]$, $p = (X, Y) > q = (X)$ and $I = pq = (X^2, XY)$.

We have $\sqrt{I} = q$. Since this is a prime, (1.24) tells us that $q$ is the
only minimal prime over $q$. It is possible to show that $\Ass(R/I) = \set{p, q}$.
In particular, $I$ is not primary, but we can write
\[ I = (X^2, XY, Y^2) \cap (X), \]
where $(X^2, XY, Y^2) = (X, Y)^2$ is $p$-primary and $(X)$ is $q$-primary.
This is an example of a primary decomposition.
