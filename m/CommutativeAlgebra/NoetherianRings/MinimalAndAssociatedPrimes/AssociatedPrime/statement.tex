Let $R$ be a noetherian ring and let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module.
We call a prime ideal  $p$ an associated prime of $M$ if it is the annihilator
of an element of $M$, i.e., there is $m \in M$ such that $p = \ann(m) = \set{r \in R\given rm = 0}$.

We further define
\[ \Ass(M) \coloneqq\set{p\given p\text{ prime}, \exists m \in M\colon p = \ann(m)}. \]
