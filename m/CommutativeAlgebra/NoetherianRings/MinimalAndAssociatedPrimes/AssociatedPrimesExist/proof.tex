Let $Q \in \ann(m)$ and $r_1\cdot r_2 \in Q$, but $q_2\notin Q$. We will show
that $r_1 \in Q$. Since $r_1r_2 \in Q$ we have $r_1r_2m = 0$. This means that
$r_1 \in \ann(r_2 m)$. Since, $r_2\notin Q$, we have that $r_2m\neq 0$.

We have $Q = \ann(m) \subseteq \ann(r_2m)$, and since $r_2m$ is nonzero as we have
just seen, by maximality of $Q$, we have $Q = \ann(r_2m)$. Hence,
$r_1 \in \ann(r_2m) = Q$ as required.
