If we have written $\sqrt{I} = p_1\cap\cdots\cap p_m$ with $p_i$ prime
(as we have just seen is always possible), then we can remove any $p_i$ from the
list if it is a superset of one of the others. Therefore, we may assume
that $p_i \nsubseteq p_j$ for all pairs $i\neq j$. Now if $p$ is another prime
ideal and $\sqrt{I} \subseteq p$, then $p_1\cdot\cdots\cdot p_m \subseteq \bigcap p_i = \sqrt{I} \subseteq p$,
some since $p$ is prime, one of the $p_i$ must be fully contained in $p$.
