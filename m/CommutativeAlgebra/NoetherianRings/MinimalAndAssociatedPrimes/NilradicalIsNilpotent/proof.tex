Since $R$ is noetherian, $\sqrt{I}$ is finitely generated, say by
$x_1, \ldots, x_n$. Then we find natural numbers $m_i$ such that
$x_i^{m_i}$. If we define $m\coloneqq 1 + \sum_{i = 1}^n (m_i - 1)$, then the
binomial theorem tells us that elements of the form $x_1^{r_1}\cdot\cdots\cdot x_n^{r_n}$
with $\sum_{i=1}^nr_i = m$ generate the ideal $\sqrt{I}^m$. By our choice of
$m$, for some $i$ we must have $r_i\geq m_i$, so every generator lies in $I$,
so $\sqrt{I}^m \subseteq I$.
