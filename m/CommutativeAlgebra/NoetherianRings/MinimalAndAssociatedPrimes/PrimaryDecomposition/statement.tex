If $R$ is a noetherian ring, $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module and $N \subseteq M$
is a submodule, then a primary decomposition of $N$ consists of submodules
$N_1, \ldots, N_s$ of $M$ containing $N$ such that $N_i$ is $p_i$-primary, where
the $p_i$ are pairwise distinct, such that $N = \bigcup_{i = 1}^n N_i$
(in particular, this means that there is an embedding $M/N \to \bigoplus M/N_i$).
