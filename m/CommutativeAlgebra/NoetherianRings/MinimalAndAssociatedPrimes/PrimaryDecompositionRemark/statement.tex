This primary decomposition exists (which we will not show) and is not necessarily
unique. However, Atiyah-Macdonald Chapter 4 contains two uniqueness theorems
for finitely generated modules over noetherian rings:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the $p_i$ occurring in a primary decomposition are unique and are
		precisely $\Ass(M/N)$;
	\item the $N_j$ belonging to $p_j$ which are minimal elements of the set
		$\{p_i\}$ are unique. The $N_j$ belonging to the rest of the $p_j$ (which
		are called embedded), are not necessarily unique.
\end{enumerate}

In the previous example, $q$ is minimal and $p$ is embedded, Hence, the ideal
$(X)$ is unique and the decomposition shows that $\Ass(R/I) = \set{p, q}$, which
is rather tricky to prove from first principles.
