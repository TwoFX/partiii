If $p$ is a prime over $I$, then $\sqrt{I} \subseteq p$ as $p$ is prime.
This implies that the minimal primes over $I$ are exactly the minimal primes
over $\sqrt{I}$, so the intersection of the minimal primes over $I$ is the
intersection of the minimal primes over $\sqrt{I}$, which is $\sqrt{I}$ itself.

By a previous remark, we can find minimal primes $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ such that
$p_1\cdot\cdots\cdot p_n \subseteq \sqrt{I}$. Since there is some $m$ such that
$\sqrt{I}^m \subseteq I$, we have that $p_1^m\cdot\cdots\cdot p_n^m \subseteq I$ as
required.
