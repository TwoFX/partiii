If $R$ is a $k$-algebra and $M$ and $N$ are $R$-modules, then $M\tensor_k N$ is
an abelian group, and we can declare an $R$-module structure on it
by defining $r(m\tensor n)\coloneqq rm\tensor rn$. This is called the diagonal
action. If $M$ and $N$ are finitely generated as $R$-modules, then so is
$M\tensor N$.
