\begin{itemize}
	\item The functor $\Hom({-}, N)$ is not exact. The failure of exactness is
		studied using cohomology.
	\item We do have an analogous statement for the other Hom functor: The sequence
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \arrow[r] & M_1 \arrow[r] & M \arrow[r] & M_2 \arrow[r] & 0
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		is exact if and only if
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			0\ar[r] & \Hom(N, M_1)\ar[r] & \Hom(N, M)\ar[r] & \Hom(N, M_2)
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		is exact for all modules $N$.
\end{itemize}
