Again, observe that these are not short exact sequences. Applying
${-}\tensor N$ does not in general preserve injecivity of the left hand
map. For example, consider the short exact sequence
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	0\ar[r] & \mathbb{Z}\ar[r, "\cdot 2"] & \mathbb{Z}\ar[r, "\pi"] & \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\ar[r] & 0.
\end{tikzcd}\]
Tensoring with $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, we obtain a sequence
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	0\ar[r] & \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\ar[r, "0"] & \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\ar[r] & \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\ar[r] & 0,
\end{tikzcd}\]
which fails to be exact. Hence exactness is not preserved.
