If $\varphi\colon R\to T$ is a homomorphism of rings, and $N$ is a $T$-module,
then $N$ may be regarded as an $R$-module via $rm\coloneqq \varphi(r)m$. In
particular, $T$ itself is an $R$-module. This process is called restriction
of scalars.

If $M$ is an $R$-module, then $T\tensor_R M$ is an $R$-module. It is also a
$T$-module via $t_1(t_2 \tensor m) \coloneqq (t_1t_2)\tensor m$.
