It is immediate that $\set{M'\cap M_n}$ is an $I$-filtration of $M'$:
\[ I(M' \cap M_n) \subseteq IM'\cap IM_n \subseteq M'\cap M_{n+1}, \]
using the fact that $\set{M_n}$ is an $I$-filtration.

Now we get a graded $R^*$-submodule $N\coloneqq \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} M'\cap M_n$ of $M^*$.
Since $\set{M_n}$ is stable, 5.4 yields that $M^*$ is finitely generated as
an $R^*$-module, so it is noetherian, so $N$ is finitely generated, so applying
5.4 again gives the claim.
