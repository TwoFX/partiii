Let $M$ be an $R$-module. An infinite descending chain $M_0\supseteq M_1\supseteq \cdots$
of submodules of $M$ is called a filtration. If $I$ is an ideal of $R$, then
$\set{M_n}$ is called an $I$-filtration if $IM_i \subseteq M_{i+1}$ for all $i$.
It is called a stable $I$-filtration if there is some $N$ such that for all $i\geq N$
we have $IM_i = M_{i+1}$. In particular, $\set{I^nM}$ is a stable $I$-filtration.

If $I \subseteq R$ is an ideal, the Rees ring is defined as $R^*\coloneqq \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} I^n$.
The Rees ring is isomorphic to the subring $R + IX + I^2X^2 + \cdots$ of
$R[X]$ via the obvious map. It is a graded ring.
