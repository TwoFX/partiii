The Artin-Rees lemma tells us that there is some $s$ such that for all $n\geq s$
we have $N = (I^nM)\cap N = I^{n-s}((I^sM)\cap N) = I^{n-s}N$. In particular, we
have $N = IN$.

Now (ii) follows from Nakayama (as seen on example sheet 1), and (i) follows
from some variant of Nakayama
(TODO). Furthermore, if $R$ is an integral domain and we take $M = R$, then
if $N\neq 0$, then $rN = 0$ implies that $R$ has zero divisors, a contradiction.
Finally, if $R$ is local, then all ideals are contained in $J(R)$, so by (ii)
we are done.
