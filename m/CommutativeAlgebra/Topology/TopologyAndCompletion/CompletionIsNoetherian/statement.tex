Let $r_1, \ldots, r_n$ be generators of $I$. Define
\[ \varphi\colon R[X_1, \ldots, X_n] \to R,\qquad X_i\mapsto r_i, \]
Then we have an induced ring isomorphism
$\tilde{\varphi}\colon R[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/\ker\varphi \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} R$,
and the $I$-adic topology on $R$ is the same as the $\varphi^{-1}(I)$-adic
topology on $R[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/\ker\varphi$. But $\varphi^{-1}(I) = (J + \ker\varphi)/\ker\varphi$,
where $J = (X_1, \ldots, X_n)$, and so completing $R[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/\ker\varphi$
as a ring with respect to the ideal $\varphi^{-1}(I)$ is the same as completing
it as an $R[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$-module with respect to the ideal $J$ of
$R[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$.

But then we can use the previous proposition to find that
\[ (R[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/\ker\varphi)^{\vee} \cong (R[X_1, \ldots, X_n])^{\vee}/\hat{\ker\varphi}. \]
as $R[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$-modules. It is not hard to see that this is actually
an isomorphism of rings. As previously remarked, the completion of  $R[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ with regard
to $J$ is $R[[X_1, \ldots, X_n]]$, so $\hat{R}$ is isomorphic as a ring to
a quotient of $R[[X_1, \ldots, X_n]]$, which is noetherian.
