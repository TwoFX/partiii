If $\hat{r} \in \hat{I}$, then $\hat{1} - \hat{r}$ has the multiplicative
inverse $\hat{1} + \hat{r} + \hat{r}^2$ (indeed, the partial sums are a Cauchy
sequence in the  $I$-adic completion), and so $\hat{1} - \hat{r}$ is a unit.
This means that $\hat{I} \subseteq J(\hat{R})$ (for example by Sheet 1, Exercise 10).

In particular, if $I$ is maximal in $R$, then $\hat{R}/\hat{I}\cong R/I$ is a field,
so $\hat{I}$ is maximal. Hence, $\hat{I} = J(\hat{R})$, so $\hat{R}$ is local
with maximal ideal $\hat{I}$.
