\begin{itemize}
	\item If we choose $I = (p) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ we get the usual
		$p$-adic topology. Two integers are \enquote{close together} if their
		difference is divisible by a large power of $p$.
	\item Another interesting example is $I = (f) \subseteq k[X]$, where $f$ is irreducible.

Let $\set{M_n}$ be a stable $I$-filtration of any finitely generated module $M$
over a noetherian ring $R$. If $N \subseteq M$ is a submodule, then Artin-Rees tells
us that $N\cap M_n$ is a stable $I$-filtration on $N$. Since all stable $I$-filtrations
induce the same topology, this means that the subspace topology on $N$ induced
from the $I$-adic topology on $M$ is the same as the $I$-adic topology on $N$.
