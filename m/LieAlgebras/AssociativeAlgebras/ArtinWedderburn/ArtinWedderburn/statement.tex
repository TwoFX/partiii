Let $R$ be a semisimple finite-dimensional associative algebra. Then
$R = \sum_{i = 1}^r R_i$, where $R_i = M_{n_i}(D_i)$, where $D_i$ is a
finite-dimensional division algebra. Moreover, the $R_i$ are uniquely determined.

$R$ has exactly $r$ isomorphism classes of right simple modules $S_i$ and
$D_i = \End_R(S_i)$ and $n_i = \dim_{D_i}(S_i)$.

Furthermore, if $k$ is algebraically closed, then $D_i \cong k$ for each $i$ and
thus $\mathbb{C}G$ for a finite group $G$ is $\bigoplus_{i=1}^r M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$,
where $G$ has $r$ isomorphism classes of simple modules of degree $n_i$.
