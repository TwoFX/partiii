Any class sum $\sum_{g' \in \ccl(g)}g'$ is contained in $Z(\mathbb{C}G)$.
Moreover, any element of $Z(\mathbb{C}G)$ is a linear combination of class sums.

Linear independence of the class sums is clear. Hence, the class sums form a
basis of $Z(\mathbb{C}G)$, so $\dim Z(\mathbb{C}G)$ is just the number of
conjugacy classes.

But $Z(M_n(\mathbb{C})) = \set{\lambda I\given \lambda \in \mathbb{C}}$ and so
$\dim Z(M_n(\mathbb{C})) = 1$. By Artin-Wedderburn, $\mathbb{C}G\cong \bigoplus_{i = 1}^r M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$,
so $Z(\mathbb{C}G) = \bigoplus_{i =1}^rZ(M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C}))$ and
$\dim Z(\mathbb{C}G) = r$ is just the number of isomorphism classes of simples modules.
