\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $D$ be a finite-dimensional division $k$-algebra. Then we have an
		algebra $M_n(D)$ of $n\times n$-matrices over $D$. An example of a division
		algebra are the quaternions $\mathbb{H}$.

		Let $A \in R\coloneqq  M_n(D)$. The right ideal generated by $A$ is
		$A R = \set{B \in R\given (\star)}$, where $(\star)$ means that the
		columns of $B$ lie in the right span of columns of $A$ (i.e., using right
		scalar multiplication for the linear combination).

		A general right ideal is of the form $\set{B\given (\star)}$, where $(\star)$
		means that the columns of $B$ lie in some fixed right $D$-subspace of
		column vectors.

		Similarly, the left ideal $RA$ consists of matrices $B$ such that
		the rows of  $B$ lie in the left span of $A$, and a general left ideal
		consists of matrices $B$ whose rows lie inside some left $D$-subspace
		of row vectors.

		Note that the only $2$-sided ideals are $0$ and $M_n(D)$. Hence
		$M_n(D)$ is a simple algebra.

	\item Let $k$ be a field and $G$ be a finite group. Then $kG$ is the $k$-vector
		space with basis $G$. A general element of $kG$ looks like
		$\sum_{g \in G} \lambda_g g$, where $\lambda_g \in k$. We can declare
		a product via
		\[ \left(\sum_{g \in G}\lambda_g g\right)\left(\sum_{h \in G}\mu_h h\right) = \sum_{\ell \in G}v_\ell \ell, \]
		where $v_k = \sum_{gh = \ell} \lambda_g\mu_h$.
\end{enumerate}
