Consider the group algebra $kS_3$, where $\chr k = 2$. Let $h$ denote
a $3$-cycle and $g$ denote a transposition. The element
$e_1\coloneqq1 + h + h^2$ is a linear combination of class sums and $e_2\coloneqq h + h^2$
is a class sum, hence they are both central. It is easy to verify that they are
idempotent.
Since we are in characteristic two, their sum is $1$ and we can calculate
that their product vanishes. Write $B_1\coloneqq e_1kS_3$, $B_2\coloneqq e_2kS_3$.
Then these are indecomposable ideals and $kS_3 = B_1\oplus B_2$. We may verify
that $B_1\cong kC_2$ and $B_2$ is isomorphic to the matrix algebra $M_2(k)$.

As an exercise (TODO), consider the case that $\chr k = 3$ and show that there is
one block. As a hint, try to calculate the central idempotents.
