Choose $n$ large enough so that $f^n\colon f^n(M)\to f^{2n}(M)$ is an isomorphism.
This is possible by finite-dimensionality.

Let  $m \in M$ and write $f^n(m) = f^{2n}(m_1)$. Then $m = f^n(m_1) + (m - f^n(m_1))$,
but the first summand is in the image of  $f^n$ and the second summand is in the
kernel of $f^n$. If $f^n(x) \in \ker f^n$, then $f^n(x) = 0$ since
$f^n|_{\im f^n}$ is an isomorphism. Hence $\im f^n\cap \ker f^n = 0$, completing
the proof.
