Let $R \cong \bigoplus B_j$ be a block decomposition. Write
$1 = e_1 + \cdots + e_n$, where $e_j \in B_j$. Then $e_ie_j \in B_i\cap B_j = 0$
if $i\neq j$. Hence $1 = 1^2 = e_1^2 + \cdots + e_n^2$ with $e_j^2 + B_j$. Since
we have a direct sum, comparison of components yields $e_j^2 = e_j$, i.e.,
$e_j$ is an idempotent. Now if $r = r_1 + \cdots + r_n \in R$ with $r_i  \in B_j$,
then
\[ 1r = (e_1 + \cdots + e_n)(r_1 + \cdots + r_n) = \sum_j e_jr_j, \]
again since $e_ir_j = 0$ for $i\neq j$. Similarly, $r1 = \sum r_je_j$. By comparison
of components, we conclude $re_j = e_jr$ for all $r$. In order words, the
$e_j$ are central idempotents. Each $e_j$ is the multiplicative identity of the
block $B_j = e_jR$ (the last equality is obvious: if $b \in B_j$, then $b = 1b = e_jb \in e_jR$).

Conversely, if $1 = e_1 + \cdots + e_n$ with $e_ie_j = 0$ for $i\neq j$, $e_j^2 = e_j$
and $e_j$ central, then $R = \bigoplus_j e_jR$, where the $e_jR$ are ideals since
$e_j$ is central.
