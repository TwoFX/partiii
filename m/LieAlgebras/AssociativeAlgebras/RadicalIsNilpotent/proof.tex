Let $J = J(R)$. Consider
$J \supsetneq J \supseteq J^2 \supseteq \cdots$. This must terminate by
finite-dimensionality, so  $J^n = J^{n+1}$ for some $n$. Hence, the sockle
series must terminate by the previous remark. Hence, $R = \soc_n(R)$. But then
$J^n$ annihilates $1$, but then $J^n = 0$ as required.
