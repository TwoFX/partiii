The socle series of a module $M$ is
\[ 0 = \soc_0(M) \subsetneq \soc_1(M) \subsetneq \cdots, \]
where $\soc_i(M)/\soc_{i-1}(M) = \soc(M/\soc_{i-1}(M))$ (i.e., to define $\soc_i(M)$,
pull back $\soc(M/\soc_{i-1}(M))$, which is a submodule of $M/\soc_{i-1}(M)$, along the
quotient map), as long as
$\soc_{i-1}(M)\neq M$.
