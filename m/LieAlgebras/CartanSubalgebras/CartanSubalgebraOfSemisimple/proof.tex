By the classification of Cartan subalgebras, $H = L_{0, y}$ for some
$y \in H$.

Consider the decomposition
\[ L = L_{0, y} \oplus \bigoplus_{\mathclap{\substack{\lambda\neq 0\\\text{$\lambda$ eigenvalue of $\ad(y)$}}}} L_{\lambda, y} \]
Recall $[L_{\lambda, y}, L_{\mu, y} \subseteq L_{\lambda+\mu, y}$.
If $u \in L_{\lambda, y}$, $v \in L_{\mu, y}$ with $\lambda + \mu \neq 0$, then
applying $\ad(u)\ad(v)$ maps each generalized eigenspace into a different one, so
$\tr(\ad(u) \circ \ad(v)) = 0$ (think of matrices). Thus when
$\lambda + \mu \neq 0$, the spaces $L_{\lambda, y}$ and $L_{\mu, y}$ are
orthogonal with respect to the Killing form. Hence,
\[ L = L_{0, y} \oplus (L_{\lambda, y} + L_{-\lambda, y}) \oplus \ldots \]
is an orthogonal direct sum with regards to the Killing form. But by
the Cartan-Killing criterion, we know that that Killing form is non-degenerate
on $L$. This means that its restriction to each summand is non-degenerate. In
particular, the restriction to $L_{0, y}$ is non-degenerate.
