Let $H$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra. Then
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item $H$ is abelian,
	\item the centraliser $Z_L(H) = \set{x \in L\given [x, h] = 0~\forall h \in H}$
		is $H$ itself, and so $H$ is a maximal abelian subalgebra,
	\item every element of $H$ is semisimple (i.e., $\ad(x)$ is diagonalizable for
		every $x \in H$),
	\item the restriction of the Killing form of $L$ to $H$ is non-degenerate
		(note that this restriction to $H$ is not (!) the Killing form of $H$, unlike
		in the case of restricting to an ideal)
\end{enumerate}
