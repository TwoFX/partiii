Set $\beta = c\alpha$. Consider the $\alpha$-string through $\beta$
\[ \beta - q\alpha, \ldots, \beta, \ldots, \beta + p\alpha. \]
As before, choose $x \in [L_\alpha, L_{-\alpha}]$ such that
$\alpha(x)\neq 0$. By the previous lemma,
$\beta(x) = \frac{q-p}{2}\alpha(x)$. Hence, $c = \frac{q-p}{2}$.
But if $q - p$ is even, then we're done by the previous lemma.

If $q - p$ is odd, then $r = (pq+1)/2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and satisfies
$-q\leq r\leq p$ and therefore $\beta + r\alpha$ is a root and we have
$\beta+r\alpha = (q-p+p-q+1)/2 \alpha = 1/2 \alpha$. But then
$\Phi$ contains $1/2 \alpha$ as well as $2(1/2 \alpha)$, which is not possible
by 4.16.
