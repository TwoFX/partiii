We know that $\scp{\ ,\ }_{\ad}$ is symmetric and bilinear and rationally
valued on $\tilde{H}$ by 4.20(c).

Let $x \in \tilde{H}$. Then
\[ \scp{x, x}_{\ad} = \sum_{\alpha \in \Phi} \alpha(x)^2 = \sum_{\alpha \in \Phi}\scp{h_{\alpha}, x}^2 \]
by 4.13(a). Each $\scp{h_\alpha, x}$ is rational and so
$\scp{x, x}_{\ad} \geq 0$ with equality only if
$\scp{h_\alpha, x} = \alpha(x) = 0$ for every $\alpha \in \Phi$. By 4.13(f), this
can only happen if $\alpha = 0$.

It remains to show that each .$h_\alpha$ is a rational linear combination
of $h_1, \ldots, h_r$. But if
\[ h_\alpha = \sum \lambda_i h_i \] with $\lambda_i \in \mathbb{Q}$, then
\[ \scp{h_\alpha, h_j}_{\ad} = \sum \lambda_i\scp{h_i, h_j} \in \mathbb{Q} \]
by 4.20(c). Hence the matrix with entries $\scp{h_i, h_j}$ is nonsingular
by non-degeneracy and has entries in $\mathbb{Q}$. Hence it is invertible over
$\mathbb{Q}$, so each $\lambda_i \in \mathbb{Q}$ as required.
