Suppose $L$ is a semisimple complex Lie algebra. Then by (4.10) a CSA $H$ of $L$
is abelian and all elements are semisimple. Then $L$ breaks up as a direct
sum of common eigenspaces of the elements of $\ad(H)$.

An easy induction on the dimension of $H$ establishes this: take $h_1, \ldots, h_r$
to be a basis of $H$. By induction $L$ splits as a direct sum of common eigenspaces
for $\ad(h_1), \ldots, \ad(h_{r-1})$. These break up as direct sums of eigenspaces of
$\ad(h_r)$.

On each of these common eigenspaces, $\ad(h)(x) = \alpha(h)x$ for some linear form
$\alpha\colon H\to \mathcal{C}$. Define
\[ L_\alpha\coloneqq\set{x \in L\given \ad(h)(x) = \alpha(h)x}. \]
Notice that $L_0 = H$ since $L_0 = Z_L(H) = H$ using 4.10. Thus we have the
following definition.
