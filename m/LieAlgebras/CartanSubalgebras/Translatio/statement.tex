Now we can translate these results to make similar statements concerning the
$\mathbb{Q}$-span of $\Phi$ using the symmetric bilinar form $(\ ,\ )$ on $H^*$.

Let $\tilde{H}^*$ be the rational dual of $\tilde{H}.$
Then $\tilde{H}^*$ is the $\mathbb{Q}$-span of $\Phi$ by 4.20(c).

The bilinear form $(\ ,\ )$ restricts to $\tilde{H}^*$ and defines an
inner product on $\tilde{H}^*$, and subset $\Phi'$ of $\Phi$ that
is a $\mathbb{C}$-basis of $H^*$ and a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis of
$\tilde{H}^*$.
