If $L$ is a semisimple complex finite-dimensional Lie algebra, then the decomposition
\[ L = L_0 \oplus \left(\bigoplus_{\alpha\neq 0} L_{\alpha}\right) \]
is called the weight space or Cartan decomposition with regard to the Cartan
subalgebra $H$. Notice that $L_0 = H$. The $\alpha$ such that $L_\alpha\neq 0$ are
called the weights. The space $L_\alpha$ is called the weight space if $\alpha$ is
a weight. The non-zero weights are called the roots with respect to $H$.

We denote the set of roots of $L$ by $\Phi$. We define $m_\alpha\coloneqq \dim L_\alpha$.
