We have $\Der(k[X]) = \set{fD\given f \in k[X]}$,
where $D\colon k[X]\to k[X]$ is the differential
(straightforward proof by induction).

$\Der(k[X, X^{-1}])$ is called the Witt Lie algebra, which is closely related
to the Virasoro algebra (appears in geometry and physics). It is
infinite-dimensional.

Geometrically, when $R$ is a coordinate ring, then $\Der(R)$ corresponds to vector
fields. However, $R$ need not be commutative in the general case.
