\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
	\item If $R$ is commutative, then $\Innder(R) = 0$.
	\item At the end of the commutative algebra course you may meet Hochschild
		cohomology (a cohomology theory for associative algebras). The first
		Hochschild cohomology group $HH^1(R, R)$ is the quotient
		$\Der(R)/\Innder(R)$, which is a Lie algebra.
	\item Lie algebras appear as derivations of other algebraic structures. For
		example for the octonians one gets the Lie algebra $G_2$.
