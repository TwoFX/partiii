The centre of $\mathfrak{L}$ is defined to be
\[ \ker\ad_{\mathfrak{L}} = \set{x \in \mathfrak{L}\given \forall y \in \mathfrak{L}\colon [x, y] = 0}. \]

Note that if the centre is $0$ then the adjoint representation is injective and
we can regard $\mathcal{L}$ as a subalgebra of $\End \mathfrak{L}$. If
$\mathfrak{L}$ is finite-dimensional, then $\mathfrak{L}$ is a subalgebra of
$\mathfrak{gl}_n\cong \End \mathfrak{L}$, where $n = \dim \mathfrak{L}$.
