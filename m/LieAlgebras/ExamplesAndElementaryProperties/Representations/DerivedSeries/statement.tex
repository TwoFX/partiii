The derived series of $\mathfrak{L}$ is defined inductively:
$\mathfrak{L}^{(0)}\coloneqq \mathfrak{L}$,
$\mathfrak{L}^{(n+1)}\coloneqq [\mathfrak{L}^{(n)}, \mathfrak{L}^{(n)}]$,
where $[\mathfrak{L}, \mathfrak{L}]$ is the span (!) of the elements of the
form $[x, y]$, $x, y \in \mathfrak{L}$.

We call $\mathfrak{L}^{(1)}$ the derived subalgebra of $\mathfrak{L}$.

Note that $\mathfrak{L}^{(i)}$ is a Lie ideal of $\mathfrak{L}$: this follows
from induction and the Jacobi identity.
