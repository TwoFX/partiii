Note that $\bigoplus V_n = k[X, Y]$.

A note about terminology: Strictly speaking, the representation is the map
$\mathfrak{L}\to \End(V)$. Often, $V$ is also called the representation. This
is an abuse of notation. In this course, we will use the term \enquote{module}
for $V$, for example \enquote{$V$ is a module for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$} or
\enquote{$V$ is a $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-module.} Similarly, we'll sometimes use
the term \enquote{simple module} to refer to irreducible representations.

We'll see later that the $V_n$ are precisely the simple finite-dimensional
$\mathfrak{sl}_2$-modules up to isomorphism.

Also any finite-dimensional $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-module is a direct sum of copies
of the $V_n$.

However, there are infinite-dimensional $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-modules that aren't
such direct sums. There will be an example on the example sheet.
