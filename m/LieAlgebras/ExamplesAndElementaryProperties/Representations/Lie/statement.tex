Assume that $k$ is algebraically closed of characteristic $0$.
Again, let $\mathfrak{L} \subseteq \End V$ be a subalgebra with $\dim V<\infty$.
Suppose that $\mathfrak{L}$ is soluble. Then there is some $v \in V$ such that
$v\neq 0$ and for all $x \in L$ there is $\lambda_x \in k$ such that
$x(v) = \lambda_x v$.

In words: all $x$ have a common eigenvector.
