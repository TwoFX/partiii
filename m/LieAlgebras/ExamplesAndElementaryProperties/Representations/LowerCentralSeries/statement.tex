The lower central series is defined inductively:
$\mathfrak{L}_{(1)}\coloneqq \mathfrak{L}$,
$\mathfrak{L}_{(n + 1)}\coloneqq [\mathfrak{L}_{(n)}, \mathfrak{L}]$.

Note $\mathfrak{L}_{(i)}$ are ideals of $\mathfrak{L}$.

We say that  $\mathfrak{L}$ is nilpotent if $\mathfrak{L}_{(c+1)} = 0$ for
some $c$. The nilpotency class of $\mathfrak{L}$ is the smallest such $c$.

Note that if $\mathfrak{L}$ is nilpotent, then $\mathfrak{L}$ is soluble.
