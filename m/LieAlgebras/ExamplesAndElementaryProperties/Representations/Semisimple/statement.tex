Recall that we call $\mathfrak{L}$ semisimple if $R(\mathfrak{L}) = 0$.
Note that $R(\mathfrak{L}/R(\mathfrak{L}))= 0$, since a soluble ideal of $\mathfrak{L}/R(\mathfrak{L})$
would pull back to give an ideal $R(\mathfrak{L}) \subsetneq J$ for which
$J/R(\mathfrak{L})$ is soluble, so by 2.9 $J$ would be soluble, a contradiction.
Thus, $\mathfrak{L}/R(\mathfrak{L})$ is semisimple.
