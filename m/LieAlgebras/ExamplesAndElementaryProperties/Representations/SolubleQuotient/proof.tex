For (1), it suffices to notice that for a subalgebra $J$ we have
$J^{(i)} \subseteq J\cap \mathfrak{L}^{(i)}$, and the for an ideal $L$ we have
$(\mathfrak{L}/J)^{(i)} \subseteq \mathfrak{L}^{(i)} + J$. Both statements are readily proved
by induction.

For (2), we first notice that $\mathfrak{L}^{(i)} + J \subseteq (\mathfrak{L}/J)^{(i)}$.
But since $\mathfrak{L}/J$ is soluble, this implies that $\mathfrak{L}^{(n)} \subseteq J$
for some $n$. Since $J$ is soluble, we conclude that there is some $m$ such that
$\mathfrak{L}^{(m + n)} = (\mathfrak{L}^{(n)})^{(m)} \subseteq J^{(m)} = 0$.
