Recall that $\mathfrak{n}_n$ is the Lie algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices.
Exercise: this is nilpotent for every $n$.

For example, $\mathfrak{n}_3$ is called the Heisenberg Lie algebra. It has dimension
$3$. There is an obvious basis
\[
	x=\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0\\0&0&0\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix},\quad
	y=\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0\\0&0&1\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix},\quad
	z=\begin{pmatrix}0&0&1\\0&0&0\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix}.
\]
We can calculate that $[x, y] = z$, $[x, z] = 0$, $[y, z] = 0$, so $\mathfrak{n}_3$
is nonabelian and of nilpotency class $2$. In general, we can show that
$\mathfrak{n}_n$ is of nilpotency class $n-1$.
