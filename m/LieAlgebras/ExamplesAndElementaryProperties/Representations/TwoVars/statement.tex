We define a morphism
\begin{align*}
	\rho\colon \mathfrak{sl}_2&\to \Der(k[X, Y]) \subseteq \End(k[X, Y])\\
	e&\mapsto X\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\\
	f&\mapsto Y\frac{\partial}{\partial X}\\
	h&\mapsto X\frac{\partial}{\partial X}-Y\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}
\end{align*}

An easy but somewhat lengthy calculation shows that this is a morhpism (notably,
we use the symmetry of second partial derivatives).
Note that the images of $e, f, h$ map
$V_n$, the span of the monomials of total degree $n$ ($\dim V_n = n + 1$; for example,
$V_1$ has basis elements $X$, $Y$, while $V_2$ has basis elements $X^2$, $XY$, $Y^2$)
to itself.
So we have subrepresentations $\mathfrak{sl}_2\to \End V_n$.
Exercise: think about the cases $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ and show that they are
irreducible.
