Let $\rho\colon L\to \End V$ be a finite-dimensional representation.
The Lie algebra $\rho(L) \subseteq \End V$ is isomorphic to a quotient of
$\mathfrak{L}$, hence soluble by (2.9). By Lie's theorem, we find
$0\neq v \in V$ such that $\vspan{v}$ is a $\rho$-invariant subspace, hence
$V = \vspan{v}$.
