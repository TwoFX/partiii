\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item If $L$ is the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra,
		then there is a Lie algebra representation $\rho\colon L\to \End(k[X])$
		such that $x$ is mapped to $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}X}$,
		$y$ is mapped to multiplication by $X$ and $z$ maps to the
		identity map.
	\item In characteristic $p > 0$ the ideal $(X^p)$ of $k[X]$ is mapped
		into itself by the image of $\rho$, hence $\rho$ induces a representation
		$\theta\colon L\to \End(k[X]/(X^p))$.
	\item $\theta$ is irreducible.
\end{enumerate}
