We have the calculation
\[ (\alpha + \beta, \alpha + \beta) = (\alpha, \alpha) + 2(\alpha, \beta) + (\beta + \beta). \]
If $\Phi$ is simply laced, then we actually have
\[ (\alpha + \beta, \alpha + \beta) = (\alpha, \alpha) = (\beta, \beta) > 0, \]
and the claim follows at once.

As a counterexample when $\Phi$ is not simply laced, we consider the root
system $B_2$. Using the names from the lecture, we find that
$\alpha$, $\beta + \alpha$ and $\beta + 2\alpha$ are all roots, but
$\scp{\alpha, \beta + \alpha} = 0$.
