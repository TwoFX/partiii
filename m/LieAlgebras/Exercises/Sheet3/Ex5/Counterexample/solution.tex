Consider the Lie algebra $L = \mathfrak{sp}_4$. From a previous exercise, we know
that $L$ has a Cartan subalgebra generated by $D_1 = \diag(1, 0, -1, 0)$ and
$D_2 = \diag(0, 1, 0, -1)$. We have also calculated the roots (warning:
the naming is different from the naming in the list of reduced rank $2$ root
systems)
\begin{align*}
	&\alpha & D_1&\mapsto -1 & D_2&\mapsto -1,\\
	&\beta & D_1&\mapsto -1 & D_2&\mapsto 1,\\
	&\gamma & D_1&\mapsto 2 & D_2&\mapsto 0,\\
	&\delta & D_1&\mapsto 0 & D_2&\mapsto 2.
\end{align*}
We immediately see $\scp{D_1, D_2}_{\ad} = 0$, $\scp{D_1, D_1}_{\ad} = \scp{D_2, D_2}_{\ad} = 2$,
and so the construction of the $h_\alpha$ for $\alpha \in \Phi$ yields
\begin{align*}
	h_\alpha &= -\frac{1}{2}(D_1 + D_2), & h_\beta &= \frac{1}{2}(D_2 - D_1),\\
	h_\gamma &= D_1, & h_\delta &= D_2.
\end{align*}
This allows us to calculate $(\alpha, \alpha) = \scp{h_\alpha, h_\alpha}_{\ad} = 1$,
 $(\beta, \beta) = 1$, and $(\alpha + \beta, \alpha + \beta) = (-\gamma, -\gamma) = 2$.
Thus, $\alpha, \beta \in \Phi'$, but $\alpha + \beta = -\gamma \notin \Phi'$. Furthermore,
the Lie bracket of the generators of $L_\alpha$ and $L_\beta$ is a nonzero element
of $L_{-\gamma}$, so $L_0 + \sum_{\alpha \in \Phi'} L_\alpha$ is not a
Lie subalgebra of $L = \mathfrak{sp}_4$.
