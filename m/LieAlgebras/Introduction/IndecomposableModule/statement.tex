An $R$-module $M$ is indecomposable if one cannot express it as
$M = M_1\oplus M_2$ with $M_1, M_2\neq 0$.

We will consider quivers where the path algebras only have finitely many
isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules. These quivers are called
quivers of finite representation type.

The classification due to Gabriel again involves root systems labelled by
Dynkin diagrams.
