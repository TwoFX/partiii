\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item $\mathfrak{L}$ is semisimple if $R(\mathfrak{L}) = 0$. In general
		$\mathfrak{L}/R(\mathfrak{L})$ is semisimple.
	\item $\mathfrak{L}$ is simple if the only ideals are $0$ and $\mathfrak{L}$.
\end{enumerate}

We will see that semisimple Lie algebras are direct products of finitely many
simple ones. In this course we will concentrate on the simple complex Lie
algebras.

We will find that classifying these boils down to classifying finite root systems,
which are collections of combinatorial data. Root systems have a symmetry group
called the Weyl group and are labelled by Dynkin diagrams.

Root systems also appear in the representations of quivers (i.e., directed graphs)
arising in algebraic geometry.
