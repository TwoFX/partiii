\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item $R$ is semisimple if $J(R) = 0$, and in general $R/J(R)$ is semisimple.
	\item $R$ is simple if the only ideals are $0$ and $R$.
\end{enumerate}

Exercise: $M_n(k)$ is a simple algebra (work out the left and the right ideals).

We will prove the Artin-Wedderburn theorem which says the finite-dimensional
semisimple algebras are direct products of simple ones, where simple algebras
are isomorphic to $M_n(D)$, where $D$ is a division algebra, where $\dim_k D<\infty$.

An example of a skew field are the quaternions $\mathbb{H}$. They are an
$\mathbb{R}$-algebra with a basis $1, i, j, k$ such that $ij = k, ji = -k$.
The quaternions are not a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra.

Artin-Wedderburn applies in
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item representation theory of finite groups,
	\item path algebras $R$ of quivers, where $R$-modules correspond to representations
		of quivers.
\end{enumerate}
