\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item A $k$-subspace $J$ of $R$ is a left ideal if $\forall r \in R, s \in J\colon rs \in J$.
		Right ideals are define analogously. A (2-sided) ideal is both a left and a right
		ideal.

		We'll see that in finite-dimensional $k$-algebras there is a canonical ideal, the
		Jacobson radical $J(R)$.
\end{enumerate}
