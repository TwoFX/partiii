A derivation of a Lie algebra is a $k$-linear map $D\colon \mathfrak{L}\to \mathfrak{L}$
such that $D([x, y]) = [x, D(y)] + [D(x), y]$.

An inner derviation is of the form $y\mapsto [x, y]$. In other words, it is
$\ad_x$ for some $x$.

The derivations of $\mathfrak{L}$ form a Lie subalgebra $\Der \mathfrak{L} \subseteq \End \mathfrak{L}$,
and $\ad(\mathfrak{L})$ is a Lie ideal of $\Der \mathfrak{L}$.
