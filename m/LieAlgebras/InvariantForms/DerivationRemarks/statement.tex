\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\Der \mathfrak{L} = \ad_{\mathfrak{L}}$ is the same as saying that
		the first Lie algebra cohomology group of $\mathfrak{L}$, which is
		isomorphic to $\Der \mathfrak{L}/\ad(\mathfrak{L})$ vanishes when
		$\mathfrak{L}$ is semisimple.
	\item If $\mathfrak{L}$ is nonzero and nilpotent, then
		$\Der \mathfrak{L}/\ad(\mathfrak{L})$. This is question 17 on the
		example sheet.
	\item There are some soluble non-nilpotent $\mathfrak{L}$ where
		$\Der \mathfrak{L}/\ad(\mathfrak{L}) = 0$. This is question 16 on the
		example sheet.
\end{enumerate}
