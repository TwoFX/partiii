If $\chr k = 0$ and $\mathfrak{L}$ is a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra,
then $\Der \mathfrak{L} = \ad_{\mathfrak{L}}$.

Since $\mathfrak{L}$ is semisimple
and the kernel of the map $\mathfrak{L} \to \ad_{\mathfrak{L}}$ is an abelian ideal,
it must be zero (since it is trivially soluble), so we additionally get
$\ad_{\mathfrak{L}} \cong \mathfrak{L}$.
