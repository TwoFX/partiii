\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item If $\rho\colon \mathfrak{L}\to\End V$ for $\dim V<\infty$ is a Lie algebra
representation, then
		\[ \vspan{x, y}_p = \tr (\rho(x) \circ \rho(y)) \]
		is called the trace form of $\rho$.

	\item The trace form of the adjoint representation of $\mathfrak{L}$
		for $\dim \mathfrak{L} < \infty$ is called the Killing form.
