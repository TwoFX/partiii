Let $x$ be an endomorphism.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item There are unique endomorphisms $x_s$ and $x_n$ such that
		$x_s$ is semisimple, $x_n$ is nilpotent, $x_s$ and $x_n$ commute
		and $x = x_s + x_n$.
	\item There are unique polynomials $p, q$ with zero constant term such that
		$x_s = p(x)$, $x_n = q(x)$. Hence $x_s$, $x_n$ commute with all endomorphisms
		that commute with $x$.
	\item If $U \subseteq V \subseteq X$ such that $x(W) \subseteq U$, then
		$x_s(W) \subseteq U$ and $x_n(W) \subseteq U$.
\end{enumerate}
