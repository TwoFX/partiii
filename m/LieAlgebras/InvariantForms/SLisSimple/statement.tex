Assume that $\chr k\neq 0$. We will show that $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ is simple.
We have met irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. In particular
$\mathfrak{sl}_2\to \End(V_n)$, where $V_n$ are the homogenous polynomials in two
variables of degree $n$. We noted that when $n = 2$, then this is just the
adjoint representation. Thus the adjoint representation is irreducible, hence
$\mathfrak{sl}_2$ is simple.
