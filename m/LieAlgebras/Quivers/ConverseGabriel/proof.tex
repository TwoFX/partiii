This proof is due to Bernstein-Gel'fand-Panomarev 1972.

Choose an admissible numbering of $Q$, let $\mathcal{C}^+$ be the
corresponding Coxeter functor, and let $c$ be the corresponding Coxeter
element.

Suppose $V$ is a finite-dimensional indecomposable representation with dimension
vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell}$. From the discussion about Coxeter elements,
there is some $m\geq 1$ such that $c^m(v)$ is not positive.

By 7.26, $(\mathcal{C}^+)^m(V) = 0$ (TODO: why?). Choose $m$ as small as possible with
$(\mathcal{C}^+)^m(V) = 0$. Thus for some $j$, we have that
$\mathcal{S}^+_{j+1}\cdots \mathcal{S}_r^+(\mathcal{C}^+)^{m-1}(V)\neq 0$,
but
$\mathcal{S}^+_{j}\cdots \mathcal{S}_r^+(\mathcal{C}^+)^{m-1}(V) = 0$.

Thus by 7.22 we know that $\mathcal{S}_{j+1}^+\mathcal{S}_{j+2}^+\cdots \mathcal{S}_r^+(\mathcal{C}^+)^{m-1}(V)$
is the simple module concentrated at $j$ (since that is the only thing mapped to
zero) and $V\cong (\mathcal{C}^-)^{m-1}\mathcal{S}_r\cdots \mathcal{S}_{j+1}^-(S_j)$.

Thus the dimension vector $v$ of $V$ is given by
\[ c^{-m+1}s_{\alpha_r}\cdots s_{\alpha_j+1}(v_j), \]
where $v_j$ is the basis element belonging to the vertex $j$.

Note that this argument shows that any indecomposable with the same dimension
vector as $V$ is isomorphic to $V$.

Conversely, if $v$ is a positive root, then for some $m\geq 1$ the element
$c^m(v)$ is not positive. Choose the shortest expression of the form
$s_{\alpha_j}\cdots s_{\alpha_r}c^{m-1}(v)$ which is not a positive root.

Then $s_{\alpha_{j+1}}\cdots s_{\alpha_r}c^{m-1}(v) = v_j$ using 5.17(d). Thus,
$(\mathcal{C}^-)^{m-1}\mathcal{S}_r^-\cdots S_{j+1}^-(S_j)$ has dimension
vector $v$.
