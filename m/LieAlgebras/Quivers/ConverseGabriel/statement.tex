Suppose the underlying graph $\Gamma$ of a quiver $Q$ is one of the simply laced
positive definite Coxeter graphs. Then the isomorphism clasesses of
indecomposable representations correspond to the positive roots. This gives
a correspondence between dimension vectors of irreducible representations and
positive roots, where $\sum k_iv_i$ corresponds to $\sum k_i\alpha_i$, where
the $\alpha_i$ are the simple roots.

In particular, $kQ$ has finite representation type.
