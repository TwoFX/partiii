A Coxeter element $c$ of the Weyl group $W(\Phi)$ is one that is a product
of each simple reflection exactly once (but in any order). The Coxeter
elements are not unique, but they are conjugate in $W(\Phi)$ (TODO: show this),
and so they have the same order. This order is called the Coxeter number $h$
of $W(\Phi)$ (or of $\Phi$).
