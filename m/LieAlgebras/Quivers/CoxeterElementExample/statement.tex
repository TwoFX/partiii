If $\Phi$ has type $A_r$, then we have $W(\Phi) \cong S_{r+1}$, and the simple
reflections correspond to the transpositions $\begin{pmatrix}i & i + 1\end{pmatrix}$
for $1\leq i \leq r$.

For example, when $r = 2$, i.e., $W(\Phi) = S_3$, then the simple reflections
are $\begin{pmatrix}1&2\end{pmatrix}$, $\begin{pmatrix}2&3\end{pmatrix}$,
and their product is a $3$-cycle.

In general, we get an $(r+1)$-cycle.

The Coxeter number $h$ is actually the number of roots divided by the rank $r$
(TODO: why?), and so the dimension of the corresponding Lie algebra, which
is the number of roots plus the rank, is $(h+1)r$.
