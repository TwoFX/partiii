Coxeter elements were studied by Coxeter (1950s). He showed that given a
Coxeter element $c$, there is a unique plane $P$ on which $c$ acts by
rotation by $2\pi/h$.

A Coxeter element $c$ has no nonzero fixed points in $\mathbb{R}^r$, and given
any $v \in \mathbb{R}^r$ for some $m\geq 0$, the vector $c^m(v)$ is not
positive (if $c^m(v)$ is positive for all $m$, then $\sum_{i = 0}^{h-1} c^i(v)$
would be a non-zero fixed point of $c$, a contradiction).
