Suppose $1, \ldots, n$ is an admissible numbering of the vertices of $Q$
(recall: for each $j$, $j$ is a sink of $s_{j+1}s_{j+2}\cdots s_rQ$).
Then the Coxeter functor with respect to the numbering is
\[ \mathcal{C}^+\coloneqq \mathcal{S}_1^+ \circ \cdots S_{r-1}^+ \circ S_r^+. \]
This is a functor $\Rep_Q\to \Rep_Q$, noting that each arrow has been turned around twice,
so $s_1\cdots s_rQ = Q$.

Similarly, we define
\[ \mathcal{C}^-\coloneqq \mathcal{S}_r^- \circ \cdots \circ \mathcal{S}_1^- \colon \Rep_Q\to \Rep_Q. \]
