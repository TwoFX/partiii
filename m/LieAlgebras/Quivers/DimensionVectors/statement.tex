Next, we consider dimension vectors. If $V$ is a representation of $Q$ with
$\phi$ surjective in ($\dagger$), then $\dim W_i = \dim V_i$ for $i\neq j$
and
\[ \dim W_j = \left(\sum_{x\colon i\to j}\dim V_i\right) - \dim V_j. \]
Hence, the effect of applying $\mathcal{S}_j^+$ is to send the dimension vector
of $V$ to $s_{\alpha_j}$ applyied to the dimension vector of $V$, where
$s_{\alpha_j}$ is the simple reflection labelled by $\alpha_i$. Here we use
that we have a simply laced Coxeter graph. TODO: figure out what is happening
here.

Similarly, if $W$ is a representation of $s_jQ$ with $\psi$ injective
in ($\ddagger$), then the effect on the dimension vector of $W$ is the same as
applying the simple reflection $s_{\alpha_j}$.

This sort of extension to considering functors between various categories of
representations with functors corresponding to reflections in Euclidean space
is generally called categorification
