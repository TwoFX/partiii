The Ext quiver of a finite-dimensional associative algebra $R$ has vertices
labelled by isomorphism classes of simple $R$-modules and the number of arrows
$x\colon S_i\to S_j$ is the maximal number $n$ of copies of $S_j$ such that there
is an indecomposable $R$-module $X$ such that there is a short exact sequence
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	0\ar[r] & \bigoplus_{k=1}^n S_j\ar[r] & X\ar[r] & S_i\ar[r] & 0.
\end{tikzcd}\]

We will show later that this number is always finite.
