Let $Q$ be a quiver without directed cycles. If $k$ is algebraically closed,
then $kQ$ has finite representation type if and only if the underlying graph
of the quiver $Q$ is $A_r$ ($r\geq 1$), $D_r$ ($r\geq 4$), $E_6$, $E_7$ or $E_8$.
These are exactly the simply laced Coxeter graphs.

Here, the underlying graph of a Quivers is obtained by forgetting the direction
of arrows.

Note that this is independent of the direction of the arrows in the quiver.
