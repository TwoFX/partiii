Consider now that quiver $Q$ which has a single vertex $1$ and a loop $x\colon 1\to 1$.
Consider the representation given by $M_1 = k$ and $\theta_x\colon \lambda\mapsto \lambda\mu$
for some fixed $\mu \in k$.

The corresponding $kG$-module is indecomposable, and for distinct $\mu_1, \mu_2$
these representations are not isomorphic (TODO: prove this).

In particular, if $k$ is infinite, then there are infinitely many
indecomposables.

As an exercise (TODO), show that if $k$ is infinite and
$Q$ has a directed cycle, then there are
infinitely many indecomposable representations. Can you do it if $k$ is finite?

Another exercise (TODO): show that the quiver considered in the example at the
beginning of the chapter has infinitely many indecomposables.
