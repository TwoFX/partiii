The path algebra $kQ$ is the $k$-vector space with basis labelled by paths of any
length (including $0$). The multiplication is given on basis elements by
concatenation of paths. If two paths cannot be concatenated, then the
product is defined to be zero.

In the previous example, we have two paths of length $0$, $e_1$ and $e_2$ and
two paths of length $1$, $x$ and $y$, and no paths of any other length.
The products come out to $e_1x = x$, $e_y = y$, $e_2x = 0$, $e_2y = 0$,
$xe_1 = 0$, $xe_2 = x$, $ye_1 = 0$, $ye_2 = y$, $xy = 0$, $yx = 0$, $e_1^2 = e_1$,
$e_2^2 = e_2$.

Observe that paths of length $0$ are idempotent elements of the path algebra.
