A quiver $Q$ is a directed multigraph. It has vertices (usually labelled
$i$, $j$, \ldots) and arrows. There is no restriction on the number of arrows
between any ordered pair of vertices (in particular, we allow loops).

As a matter of notation, if $i\stackrel{x}{\longrightarrow} j$ is an arrow,
we say that  $i$ is the source of $x$ and $j$ is the target of $x$.
