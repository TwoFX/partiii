Let $S_1$  and $S_2$ be two simple $R$-modules. Then $S_1$ and $S_2$ arise from
the same block if and only if the vertices of the Ext quiver corresponding to
$S_1$ and $S_2$ are in the same component of the Ext quiver (TODO: undirected
component or strongly connected component)?

Hence, the blocks of $R$ correspond to the components of the Ext quiver.
