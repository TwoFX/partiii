 A vertex of $Q$ is a sink if it is the target of all arrows meeting the
 vertex (i.e., it does not have any outgoing arrows).

 Similarly, a vertex is a source if it does not have any incoming arrows.

Clearly, any finite quiver without directed cycles has at least one source
and at least one sink.
