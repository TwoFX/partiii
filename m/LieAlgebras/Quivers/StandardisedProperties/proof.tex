Follows from $Q$ being standardised and that if $j_1, \ldots, j_s$ are distinct
vertices, then $i\to j$ in $s_{j_1}s_{j_2}\cdots s_{j_s}Q$ if
\begin{itemize}
	\item $i\to j$ in $Q$ and either none or both of  $i, j$ appear in $j_1, \ldots, j_s$, or
	\item $i\leftarrow j$ in $Q$ and exactly one of $i, j$ appears in $j_1, \ldots, j_s$.
\end{itemize}
