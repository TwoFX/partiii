One may have orthogonal automorphisms of $\Phi$ that are not in $W(\Phi)$ (which
we showed was generated by the simple reflections).

For example, one can take an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram (that indeed
induces an automorphism of the root system), e.g., we can flip $A_r$. This
automorphism is not part of the Weyl group since we showed in 5.19(d) that
if an element of $W(\Phi)$ leaves the set of simple roots invariant, then it
has to be the identity. Since the vertices of the diagram are exactly
the simple roots, the flip satisfies this condition.
