Every connected non-empty Coxeter graph associated to an irreducible reduced root
system is isomorphic to one of the following
\begin{itemize}
	\item $A_r$ ($r\geq 1$) is a path with $r$ vertices and $r - 1$ single edges.
	\item $B_r$ ($r\geq 2$) is a path with $r$ vertices and $r - 1$ single edges, but
		the final edge is a double edge.
	\item $D_r$ ($r\geq 4$) is a path with $r - 1$ vertices plus another vertex connected
		to the second-to-last vertex of the path.
	\item $E_6$ is a path with $5$ vertices with another vertex connected to the middle
		vertex.
	\item $E_7$ is a path with  $6$ vertices with another vertex connected to one of
		the middle vertices.
	\item $E_8$ is a path with $7$ vertices with another vertex connected to the
		middle vertices.
	\item $F_4$ is a path with $4$ vertices and the middle edge is a double edge.
	\item $G_2$ consists of two vertices connected by a triple edge.
\end{itemize}

The ones coming from simply laced irreducible root systems are exactly the ones without
double edges, i.e., they are $A_r$, $D_r$, $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$.
