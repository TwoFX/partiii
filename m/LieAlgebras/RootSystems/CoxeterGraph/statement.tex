A Coxeter graph is a finite graph such that each pair of distinct vertices are joined
by $0$, $1$, $2$ or $3$ edges. Given a root system $\Phi$ and a base $\Delta$,
the Coxeter graph (or unlabelled Dynkin diagram) of $\Phi$ with respect to $\Delta$
has as vertices the element of $\Delta$. A vertex $\alpha$ is joined to $\beta\neq \alpha$ by
$n(\alpha, \beta)n(\beta, \alpha)$ edges.
