The Coxeter graphs give insufficient information to recover the Cartan
matrix of the root system---we want something additional to indicate the
relative lengths of the roots in the multiple edge cases.

We orient the double edges of the Coxeter graphs by having them point towards
the shorter root. In this way, the family $B_r$ splits into $B_r$, where
the double edge is directed toward the final vertex, and $C_r$, wehere the
double edge is directed toward the second-to-last vertex.

For $F_4$ and $G_2$, we also get directed versions, but they are symmetric.

We do not need arrows in the simply laced cases.
