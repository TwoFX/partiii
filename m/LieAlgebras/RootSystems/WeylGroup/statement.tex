The Weyl group $W(\Phi)$ of a root system $\Phi$ is the group generated
by the reflections $s_\alpha$ ($\alpha \in \Phi$). It is a subgroup
of the orthogonal group of $E$.

Note that since $\Phi$ is finite and spans $E$ and each $s_\alpha$ leaves $\Phi$
invariant, $W(\Phi)$ must be finite. Hence, $W(\Phi)$ is a finite reflection
group.
